This version of the Variant Target Model results in a graph with (potentially)
many components (returned as G by human_family_network()) and a version with a
single weakly connected component (returned as G_connected by
human_family_network()) (see Chapter 5 in Kolton's thesis))

The main guts of the model are in the make_model() method.  There is
an example of how to run the model is on the bottom

This version new an updated to implement a class structure (in hopes to make updating code more efficient)

    PARAMETERS:

    METHODS (To call on the object):
        HumanFamily(name): Initializes the model, recording data from the model "name"
        make_model(init_gen_size): Makes the model, given an initial size for the first generation
            if save=True, the distributions of distance to unions are stored in graphs in ouptut folder
            if method='BFS', the model will use the BFS method to form marriage unions
        build_single_component(): Builds a single component graph from the model
            if save=True, the distributions of distance to unions are stored in graphs in ouptut folder
    ATTRIBUTES:
        Initialized when the object is created:
            save (bool): should you save pickled versions of networkx graphs, model
                union edges, and distance to union and child distributions, as well
                as png graphs of distance to union updates each generation as well
                as an xlsx file summarizing model growth? should you print debug info?
            marriage_dists: (list of int) one entry per marriage indicating how many
                generations between spouses (reported in the number of parent-child
                edges crossed so that distance between siblings is 2) in the
                specified dataset.  If no common ancestor (IE an infinite distance)
                then the corresponding entry is -1
            num_marriages: (int) total number of marriage edges in the specified
                dataset
            prob_inf_marriage: (float) number of infinite marraiges divided by total
                number of marriages in the specified dataset
            prob_finite_marriage: (float) number of non-infinite marriages divided
                by total number of marriages in the specified dataset
            children_dist: (list of int) one entry per pair of parents, indicating
                how many child edges each parent in the couple share
            num_people_orig_graph: (int) total number of nodes in the real life data set.
        Created When the make_model() function is run
            num_people_first_generation (int): the number of people put in the first generation
            G (nx.DiGraph):  modeled network.  This graph can have MANY COMPONENTS.
                Each node has the following attributes: 1) layer: either an int
                    indicating the vertice's generation 2) immigrant: bool
                    indicating whether the vertex had parents in the graph when the
                    vertex was originally added to the graph.  All vertices in the
                    initial generation are immigrants, as are those brought in to
                    form additional infinite-distance unions. 3) parents: int in
                    {0, 1, 2}, counting the number of incoming parent-child type
                    edges.  When joining up components into a single component
                    (forming G_connected), we only allow immigrant vertices to have
                    at most two incoming ancestral lines (i.e. paternal and
                    maternal).
                Each edge has the following attributes: 1) Relationship: str, either
                    "Marriage" to indicate a union edge or "Parent-Child".  Again,
                    Parent-Child edges go from parent to child.
            all_marriage_edges (list of tuples of int): this lists all union-type
                edges added to G (indicated by node attribtute
                "Relationship"=="Marriage").  NOTE:  The auxiliary ancestry added
                prior to generation 0 contains no union-type edges, so that G and
                G_connected share the same list of union edges.
            all_marriage_distances (list of int): this lists all distances prior to
                union for each union edge in all_marriage_edges (orders match).
                NOTE: these distances are those as observed in G with auxiliary
                ancestry prior to generation 0.  These distances are also the
                distances for the unions in G_connected.
            all_children_per_couple (list of int): this lists the number of children
                per union edge in G and in G_connected.  NOTE: because the auxiliary
                ancestry contains no union edges, the parent-child relationships
                encoded therein do not affect this distribution.  That is, G and
                G_connected have the exact same list of children per union.
            out_dir (str): destination directory for save output.  Each run will
                create an out_dir/{name}_{int}/ file structure, counting version
                number automatically
            dies_out (bool):  False indicates that the model exited successfully---
                generations 0 to L (inclusive) contain more than when_to_stop nodes
                in total OR L >= num_gens.  True else.
            summary_statistics (tuple): Ordered tuples of integers 
                (# total people in graph,  # immigrants, # num_children, # num marriages, 
                self.prob_inf_marriage, self.prob_finite_marriage, self.prob_inf_marriage(eligible_only), 
                self.prob_finite_marriage(elegible_only))
            method (str): Used to tell make_model which method it should use when forming marraige unions
                'NetworkX' - Use Networkx BFS to find a mate of specified distance
                BFS - Do a BFS up the tree to determine which nodes to avoid while traversing done
            fixed (boolean): Used to determine if we use a fixed probability distribution or not
