## Section 1
March 20, 2023.  A multistake FHE was happening at one of the stake centers, and they had free food, so I invited Gyuna if she wanted to go.  She asked if her friend could join, so the three of us went in her friend’s car.  Gyuna sat behind me, and she kept poking the back of my neck.  Dang it, of course she wanted me to sit up front so she could do that to me.

"Oh my gosh, the line is way too long," Gyuna complained at least five times while waiting in line.  It took about half an hour before we got our food.

"See, wasn't it worth the wait?" I asked after we got our food.

"No," Gyuna replied.

The three of us decided to hang out at Gyuna's place.  As we were on our way, Gyuna kept poking the back of my neck.  I felt pretty humiliated and annoyed, so I turned around and squeezed her arms and legs in defense.

But she kept persisting and provoking the situation.  "Hey!" I said as I swatted her hand in front of my face.

"Oh my gosh, that's so annoying," Gyuna said when I hit her hand.

"Do you guys fight like this?" her friend asked.

"No, not at all," Gyuna replied.  I wondered why she was being so dramatic about the whole situation.

She put her hand on the back of my seat, claiming that she wasn't touching me, but I knew she was saying that in order to touch me at the last second.  In defense, I punched her hand so that I wouldn't feel like I'd get even more defensive.

"Michael, you're being really annoying!  You chipped my nail, you jerk!" Gyuna exclaimed.

"I chipped your nail?" I asked.  I didn't know if she was trying to be dramatic or if she really meant it, but she did sound annoyed.  It seemed like she was in a mood for some reason.

I could tell she was in a mood because when I was getting out of the car, Gyuna opened the door so that I couldn't get out.  I wasn't sure if she was going to get out.  "Move!" she said rudely.

"Get out!" I said back.  I knew she was trying to provoke a situation where I'd shut the door on her so that she could feel justified for her feelings of being moody.

At the apartment, Gyuna wanted to watch a movie, so we did.  I could tell she was still in a mood because anytime I didn't understand something, she'd get impatient and say a patronizing comment like, "The movie literally tells it all.  How are you not getting it?"

And then while she was on the phone with Christian, she basically ranted about the whole fiasco in the car.  I tried to apologize, but she just interrupted me while she blew up.

Christian laughed in response, probably because he had never seen Gyuna so reactive and hateful towards me.  "Gyuna, calm down!  Didn't he at least apologize?"

"I don't think so!"

"I did, but you decided to interrupt me," I said.

"You said you were sorry?"

"Yes!"  Gyuna looked at me as if she were skeptical.  I knew it wouldn't count if she didn't know it.  "I'm sorry," I repeated.

"Okay, I'm sorry I touched you," she said.  But it sounded absentminded as if she apologized only because I did.  She handed the phone to her friend and then went to the bathroom, which she usually did when she felt overwhelmed or upset.  Christian asked Gyuna’s friend if she could check up on Gyuna and then handed the phone to me.

"Hey, has Gyuna being acting moody all day?" Christian asked me.

"I don't know about all day since I haven't been with her all day, but she was pretty moody at the activity.  She said she was hangry."

"Oh, that makes sense."

"I didn't mean to hurt her, but she was being kind of annoying, not gonna lie."

"Yeah, well, you know not to tease her when she's in a mood."

I knew it was immature of me to punch her, but I guess it was too bad that she and I had to get into a fight for her to realize that I had my boundaries with physical touch.  But I felt like this silly fight wasn't worth not being friends anymore, so I tried moving on and forgiving her.

However, I could tell she hadn't moved on.  A couple days after the incident, I asked her if she was going to be on campus later that day to hang out.

```Gyuna: No```

That was all she texted after a few hours.  I asked her to help me with my piece at the mission reunion too, but she didn't respond.  After not getting a response from her after 24 hours, I decided to ask someone else to help me.  If she didn’t want to help, then I could perform without the narration.  But I reached out to some other people and eventually found someone else, even though it was just the day before the mission reunion.  I let Gyuna know that I found someone else and that she didn’t have to narrate.

```Gyuna: Ok fine```

I knew how girls were when they were in a mood similar to Gyuna's from high school experiences.  They'd get into a mood and then ignore me for whatever reason.  I wasn't sure if it was because they thought such a tactic was a great way to hurt me or if they were too scared or ashamed to resolve the issue because of what they had done or if they just needed time to breathe.  But it would've been nice to at least communicate that they needed some space to reflect on the situation.  At least from high school, girls wouldn't confront the situation and instead gossip to other people to feel validated and justified for what they did.  Then they'd try to find ways to intentionally provoke the person to be hurtful and then complain more about how so-and-so had been trying to be hurtful.  I didn't think it was a healthy way of resolving conflict.  She didn't necessarily hurt me, but it seemed like that was her intention from her behavior of ignoring me.  I felt like she and I would have to communicate about our boundaries because I didn't want to hurt her, and I didn't want her to blow up.  But if she didn't want to respond or be friends anymore, that was outside my control.  I was going to move on and find other people if that was going to be the case.


March 23, 2023.  Healing from my breakup was weird.  I felt like it should've taken a lot longer for me to heal than it did with Kent, but I felt pretty normal after only a few days.  It was as if my relationship was all a dream.  I had met Bryce for only a month and a half, and now it was as if he and I had never met before.  I couldn't believe I had been in a relationship.

I decided to give Connor a text about the breakup and how I was still trying to heal completely from it.  He said he was willing to listen, so I told him some of the story.  He and I texted each other for the next couple days.  He said he was going to a Taylor Swift concert in Las Vegas with some of his friends over the weekend.  He was going to leave on Friday, and we both wanted to see each other before he left.  I guess it was a good thing that I wanted to see him.  It was sort of a last-minute arrangement, but he picked me up from my apartment Thursday night.

I was pretty nervous.  But it was a good kind of nervous.  It seemed like he liked me, but I was still skeptical.

"Hey, long time no see," I greeted when I got into his car.  It was weird seeing him again.  It had been about two months since I last saw him in person.

Connor said he wanted to grab something to eat, so we went to In 'N Out. "So how long were you and Bryce dating?" he asked.

"It was about a month and a half," I answered.  "It was short, but it was a good experience.  I'm really glad he was my first relationship.  I feel like I've been trying to learn how to balance what my logical mind and what my emotions are telling me."

"Aren't we all trying to figure that out?"

"Dating is so complicated.  I didn't realize it would be like this."

After some more talk, I asked, "So what are your expectations when it comes to a relationship, or what are you looking for?"

"I'm not sure," he answered.  "I'll let you answer that first."

Fair enough.  I thought it was a vague question when I was first asked that.  "A person's character is what really stands out to me in the long run.  Things like respect and patience are super important to me, and those kinds of characteristics are what I'm looking for.  Of course, personality is a factor too and can play a part in a person's character and interests, but I don't think they're as important as character.  I've never met anyone who's quite like me, and I do feel like I vibe better with people who are more outgoing than me and like my company.  I hope that I can be with someone who likes to try new things and who will teach me and show me things that interest him."

“I think patience is important for me as well,” Connor said.  “It does take me a while for me to process my feelings, and I sometimes need time to think things out.  But once I make a decision, I’m confident and pretty set in that decision.”

“So you try to figure out how you’re feeling and then make a decision based on how you feel?”

“Yeah, pretty much.”

“What got you interested in going on a date with me?”

“Well, after about a month, I started to feel like, ‘Wow, I really miss Michael.’”

“I mean, we could’ve seen each other sooner and been friends.  I was surprised you didn’t take up on that.”

I was probably a bit direct saying that because he looked a bit flustered.  “I think I’m still trying to figure out my feelings about that.”

But it was good seeing him again.  When he dropped me off, he and I got out of the car and gave each other a big hug.  The way he looked at me afterwards reminded me of the time he and I hugged outside in the snow the first time I met him in person.  He and I planned on a date next week, and I was actually excited about it!

March 24, 2023.  Today was the day of the mission reunion.  As far as people, there wasn’t anything particularly exciting.  There were a lot of familiar faces, but I didn’t know anyone well enough to feel like I could just start talking to them.  The performance went well too.

I noticed in the middle of the reunion that Christian messaged me and asked if I could check up on Gyuna.  He said she hadn’t been feeling well lately.  I hadn’t seen her since the beginning of the week, and she’d only respond with passive aggressive texts.  I wasn’t happy about how she was being dramatic about things.  I didn’t think she wanted me to see her in the first place, but if she was using Christian as a messenger, she should’ve been the one to reach out to me directly after the way she had been treating me.  Christian suggested that I reach out to her again, but I had already done so a couple times and only got toxic responses.

```Me: I think I’ll let her take the initiative on this one. I already hit the ball a couple times to her side, and she didn’t take them. It’s her turn now. If she feels like she can’t forgive me over a silly fight, that’s too bad, but I’m not going to force anything on her. She shouldn’t feel like she can get whatever she wants just because she feels a certain way, even if it means she has to swallow her pride.```

March 28, 2023.  Connor and I planned on eating at K’s Kitchen and then bowling at Fat Cats.
“How was the Taylor Swift concert?” I asked.

“It was so good!” Connor answered.  “Seriously one of the best nights of my life.  I was screaming with all the teenage girls, and we all sang along.”

I used to pass K’s Kitchen all the time when I went to pick up my medication, but I never tried it before.  It was a Japanese restaurant, and we ate some donburi.  “We’ll be in Japan for a couple weeks,” Connor said.  “I’m so excited to eat food there.”

“I wish I could eat food there,” I said.  “Do you know what you’ll be doing?”

“Yeah, we’ve got a whole plan.  We’ll be in the Tokyo area for the first bit and then be in Sapporo.  We’ll be doing lots of sightseeing, and I’ve been trying to get in contact with members around Sapporo to visit.”

After we ate, we went bowling.  “I took a couple bowling classes,” Connor said.  “A few of my cousins and I went bowling with our instructor since we were pretty good, and it was a lot of fun.”

“Well, I bowl like once a year on average,” I said.  “Any tips for how to bowl?”

He put his hand on my back as I stood in the bowling lane.  “See the lines in the middle of the lane?” he pointed.  “I make sure that the ball rolls on the middle mark.  I don’t even look at the pins.”

It seemed to work.  We ended up playing four rounds since we had an hour of playtime.

After bowling, we found a place to cuddle in the back of his car.  Wow, I didn’t realize how good it felt to lay my head against his chest again.  His music was playing in the background, and yeah, we made out a few times.  I wished he and I could’ve talked more, but cuddling felt super good.

He then took me home.  I wanted to spend more time with him not just on dates.  I hoped that he and I could study together on campus or something more casual.  I knew that Bryce and Connor were two different people, so studying together might not have been Connor’s thing.  But I still wanted to spend time with Connor somehow.

He said he and I could possibly hang out in a couple days, but he told me later that day that he was busy trying to get homework done.  Even though I told him that we could study together, he didn’t bring that up as an option.  Maybe he just needed his full attention on his homework.

March 30, 2023.  I noticed that Gyuna had tried calling me while I was on my date with Connor, so I tried calling her back a few times.  She didn’t pick up.  After she tried calling me again today, I called her back, and she picked up.

“Hello?” Gyuna answered.

“Hey, sorry I didn’t pick up earlier,” I said.  “I was in class.”

“I assumed.  I’ve been pretty busy with school trying to prepare for this one midterm and doing all this homework.  So I probably won’t be available until early next week once I finish my midterm.  I know that you’ll distract me if we hang out.”

“Okay, that’s understandable.”

We talked some more.  "Bro, you asking someone else to narrate for the musical number was such a jerk move.  And you never even texted me."

"I did text you a couple times.  And you literally didn't respond about rehearsing.  So I thought, 'I'll just give her some space,' and asked someone else.  Plus, Christian told me that you had gotten sick, so it sounds like you wouldn't have been able to make it anyway."

"I didn't respond because I was sick!  And maybe I got sick because I was feeling emotionally stressed.  That really was a jerk move.  It was your fault."

Well, if she really did become sick because of her choice to ignore me, she kinda did that to herself.  I wasn't just going to wait around for her like she was my whole world.  Plus, I didn't want to deal with someone who was going to be moody like that.  No one wanted to be around someone like that.  "I don't think it matters whose 'fault' it is," I said.

Gyuna then spoke some Korean in a dramatic tone.  I obviously didn't know what she was saying.

"You're speaking your native language," I said practically.  "You must be stressed."

"Yeah, you don't even know your mission language," she said.

"Korean is not my mission language.  I got called English speaking and was in the Korean branch for only seven months."

"No.  Korean is your mission language."

Well, it seemed like she just wanted to argue and find every excuse to be offended.  So I didn't say anything.

"Well, give me a call later,” she said.  “I need to study for this midterm and do my homework."

"When would you like me to call you?"

"I already told you that I should be available at the beginning of next week!" she said in a frustrated tone.

"Okay, do you WANT me to call you?  Cuz it doesn't seem like it."

"Yes, I want you to call me!  You jerk, you jerk, you jerk—"

"Okay, well, good luck with everything.  Bye."

"—you jerk, you jerk.  Okay, bye."  She hung up.

I guess I didn't realize how much of a prideful sac Gyuna could be.  People who wanted to find someone to blame were people who thought they didn’t have to be accountable for their own actions.  I wasn't sure if our friendship was going to last that much longer if she was going to be so emotionally immature.  I didn’t want to be around someone who was going to be toxic.  No one did.

March 31, 2023.  I was finishing up my STAT 340 homework.  This week’s homework was a lot more difficult and took a bit longer, so I was in the stats lab for the entire afternoon.  Hyeji was there too.  “I’ve been so burned out this semester,” she said.  She was taking three STAT core classes, an upper level IS class, and a linear algebra programming class.  I definitely would’ve burned out too with that kind of schedule.  “Sometimes I wake up, and I don’t want to get out of bed.  And I’ve been going to bed a lot later than usual this week.”

I heard that some of the graduate students were going to Chicken in the Kitchen—a Korean fried chicken restaurant.  I had never been there before, but the STAT 340 TA invited both Hyeji and me to go.  “It depends on if I can get my linear algebra lab finished,” Hyeji said.

“We should go!” I said.  “It’ll be fun!  Maybe after you finish your lab.”

So that was the plan.  She also told me more about her… crush?/lover?/friend?  She didn’t make much sense in the way she was explaining her feelings.  “…I see him as a friend,” she continued.  “I really do.  He reminds me of this one friend I had in high school who was kind of a jerk to me, but for some reason, I felt like I needed to take care of her.  I have those same kinds of feelings for this guy too.  But I’m also kind of scared.  I’m scared that I’ll never have the same level of feelings for another guy like him.”

Like I said, I was confused.  “So… do you actually see him as a friend, or do you still have feelings for him?  As in, more than just a friend?”

“I don’t know.  I don’t know anymore.  He’s graduating this semester, so I probably won’t see him again.”

“Maybe that’ll be a good thing.  Hopefully that’ll help you move on from these confusing feelings.”

One of Hyeji’s roommates and one of our classmates from STAT 340 ended up going to Chicken in the Kitchen with us.  The graduate students were still there, but they left after about five minutes.  The four of us then made some spontaneous plans to drive around Rock Canyon and Y Mountain.  We listened to some country music and Taylor Swift and, of course, “As If It’s Your Last.”
“‘Majimak cheoreom, ma-ma-majimak cheoreom (“As if it’s your last, as if it’s your l-l-last.”),’” Hyeji sang.

We then went to the new Music Building on campus.  On our way out of the building, it looked like something caught Hyeji’s eye.  “There’s an organ!” she exclaimed.  I heard her open the door and ask, “Hey, can you play something on the organ for us?”  I didn’t realize it was a practice room with someone already there.  But he was a good sport and played something for us.  Dang, I didn’t realize Hyeji went out of her way like that.

“It was fun!” she said when I dropped her off.  “Thanks for hanging out!”

“Yeah, it was fun!” I said.  “It’s nice to take breaks like these.  It’s a good way to recharge from studying a bunch.”

April 3, 2023.  I asked Connor if he was interested in going on another date or doing homework together.  I wasn’t sure how interested he was anymore because we didn’t have any plans of seeing each other.  He responded saying he was interested in going on another date and that it would be good to continue to get to know me and figure out how he was feeling.  He recommended that I watch Iron Man 2 as the next Marvel movie, so I suggested that.  I also wanted to pay for dinner since he paid for the last two meals, so we planned on going to Olive Garden.  So those were our plans.

```Me: Also, I’m thinking it’d be wise if we hold off on the making out stuff until we figure things out. I think that kind of stuff can mess with our head and heart. Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy that kind of stuff when I feel an emotional connection, and I still have feelings for you and think you’re really cute, but I hope those feelings can grow into something more and that we can spend time together and feel more comfortable around each other. I don’t mind hugs or holding hands in the car, but again, I think it’d be wise to save the more passionate kinda stuff for someone we want to invest time and love in. Does that make sense?```

```Connor: Yeah.. thanks for saying that. So just to be like transparent that’s basically what I am trying to figure out with my feelings. Because I definitely know I am attracted to you physically (a lot) but I think another date will help me figure out more what I’m feeling on more of an emotional level. Because I don’t want to hurt you by just being physical. So let’s go on a date and I’ll let you know where I am at sometime soon afterwards. Does that make sense/sound good? Also I hope it’s ok that I’m being this open, I just want you to know what’s going on on my side.```

Of course I wanted him to be open and honest.  I was glad he was.  But I was a bit nervous.  If he didn’t know how he was feeling emotionally about me, then it sounded like he wasn’t emotionally invested.

But we went on our date today.  We went to Olive Garden first.

"I forgot, have you come out to your family?" Connor asked.

"No, I haven't," I answered.  "It hasn't felt right.  I've actually been thinking about writing a reflection about the past school year.  I know it might be weird or unconventional to come out that way, but I feel like I'm a lot better at expressing myself through writing."

"Is there anything that makes you feel uneasy about coming out to them?  Like, are they pretty traditional?"

"I guess my family wouldn't be the first people I'd go to when it comes to personal problems and issues.  I usually go to my friends.  Plus, I don't feel like my parents share much about their personal lives.  As people have asked me questions about my parents, the more I realize I don't know them that well."

"Yeah, I get that.  I sometimes don't go to my parents as the first people to ask for help or advice.  But maybe your parents would open up more when you come out to them.  It's a very personal part of you, and it's extremely vulnerable.  I feel like it's helped strengthen my relationship with my family members.  I also feel like I come out to someone at least once a month.  Like, without fail.  Some people think I'm kidding, but I'm like, 'No!'  It's a really personal part of my life I'm sharing."

We then watched Iron Man 2.  Well, "watched."  After about 15 minutes, we ended up making out for the rest of the movie.  Dang, even though my head was telling me to wait until something more serious would form, my heart just wanted kisses from him.  And I guess he felt the same way too.

After the movie, he and I walked to my car.  "Well, I feel like it would be good to talk in person about what you're thinking as far as going on more dates," I said.

"Yeah, I think it would be good too," Connor agreed.

"I mean, I like you emotionally and physically.  I want to get to know you better and spend more time with you."

"Hm...  I know it's not fair that you know that you're interested and that I'm over here not knowing what I want.  I have such a hard time understanding my feelings.  Tell you what, I can let you know tomorrow evening.  I do know that I like you physically, but as far as emotionally, that's what I'm still trying to figure out."

"So... it doesn't sound like you're interested."

"Mmmm, Michael, I kinda don't want to talk about this right now.  I know exactly what your mind is doing!  But I still need to think about it."

"Well, I'm pretty patient, and I don't want you to make a rash decision.  But if you're not interested anymore, I don't want you to come back to me a month later or a few months later.  I want to be able to move on."

So we planned on meeting tomorrow evening.

April 4, 2023.  It was the last time it snowed in Provo.  It was a super long winter, but thankfully, the snow didn’t stick to the ground too long since it got warm enough for the snow to melt pretty quickly.

Connor and I met in front of my apartment complex, and we walked to the duck pond.  I was so nervous.  I didn’t know what his decision was going to be.

“How are you?” I greeted when I met him.

“Pretty good,” he answered.  “I slept through my alarm and woke up at 11, so I missed my 8am class.  But it’s okay, I don’t think there was anything too important in class today.”

We walked to the duck pond and talked some more.  “So as far as where we are, I know that I'm definitely physically attracted to you,” Connor said, “but as far as emotionally, I feel like we're more friends.  So I don’t think I’m interested in going on dates anymore.  I talked to my roommate yesterday night about it too.  And you also said you didn’t want things to be one-sided.  I don't think things would work out if we were to be in a relationship, and I don't want to hurt you more.  I think you deserve someone who loves you fully."

Dang.  So he wasn’t interested in me anymore?  I still thought it was weird that he still liked me physically.  "You see us as friends, but you like me physically?"  I was the complete opposite when it came to such perspectives.  Sure, someone I found physically attractive was important, but I felt like an emotional connection was even more important to me.  And I usually didn't feel as physically attracted to someone until I felt an emotional connection.  "I guess for you, what does it look like and feel like to have an emotional or romantic connection?"

"Hm...  You ask really tough questions."  Connor thought for a good while.  "I'm not sure.  I guess I haven't felt that."

That was rather odd.  I guess I still wasn't entirely sure what I was supposed to feel as far as what made me feel like a relationship would be "right."  Was I always supposed to feel butterflies?  Was I supposed to have this guy constantly on my mind?  At least with Bryce, even when I felt most attracted to him, I also felt like he and I were good friends, and I did enjoy getting to hold his hand in the car.  I felt comfortable being around him.

"Well, I'd be curious to know what feels different once you're in a relationship with someone," I said.  "What have you liked in people on past dates?"

"Well, I'd say about 97 percent of dates I've been on have been horrible.  Plus, the dating culture here at BYU is kinda toxic.  But I think what's important to me is someone who has similar interests, and I feel like that's something we differ on.  I also want someone who's selfless, which you are.  But one thing I know is that I don't think I could live life alone.  I pray every day that I meet someone I can do life with."

"Yeah, I don't think I can do life by myself either."  I was still trying to process that Connor wasn't interested anymore.  And I had warned him beforehand not to come back to me.  He had made his decision, and I was really sad.  But I was still able to keep my composure and wanted to listen and understand.  "Where do you see things going between us?  Are we going to keep in contact, or are we not going to see or speak to each other again?"

"I think it would be good to check in once in a while,” Connor answered.  “For as small a community as we are, I think it's good to keep good ties with people.  Of course, there are some bad people out there, but it's so important that we feel like we can still go to each other for help."

"That's what I've thought too.  I don't want to burn bridges with people.  Of course, there are some people who aren't all that great that I wouldn't want to be in contact with."

"Yeah.  I don't know what being friends will look like.  Maybe we'll hang out.  Or maybe we'll just text each other every now and then.  The two girls I dated are now married and have kids, but they’re some of my best friends.  And the guy I liked in October is in the same program as me, so I sometimes see him, and we occasionally say hi."

I wanted to be friends with Connor, but I wasn't entirely sure if it was because I still had feelings for him.  But I wondered what it was that made him so attracted to the one guy who had broken his heart back in October.  "The thing about being friends is that it can sometimes be so hard.”  I was just being realistic with my experiences.  “It's especially difficult when trying to find a long-term relationship because it takes up so much time."  I did think Connor would be a fun person to be around, but I knew that I needed to get over my feelings for him before I could let that happen.  One thing for sure was that I didn't want him to revert back to being a mysterious, online person.

After Connor and I talked, he and I walked back to my apartment.  "Well, thanks for understanding," he said.

I wasn't sure if I fully understood how he was feeling, but it wasn't like I could do anything about it.  "It's hard, not gonna lie," I responded.

"I know.  I wish I wasn't the cause of the pain, but I think it's best for me and you.  If we don’t see each other again before summer, I hope you have fun in Guam and Dallas.  And I’ll be sure to post pictures on Instagram when I go to Japan."

And with that, we parted.  I was so nervous only an hour ago, but now, I felt absolutely heartbroken.  I couldn't believe that things with Connor were officially over.  He was my first match, and something about that was oddly sentimental.  From the time that he and I had chatted at the end of October to the time that he and I met in person for the first time at the end of January to this time where he and I tried to date for the past couple weeks, it was so difficult for me to grasp that it was going to be the end.

I went back to my apartment and tried to do my homework, but I was too unmotivated and heartbroken.  I cried and cried.  It was definitely a lot more painful than my heartbreak with Bryce, maybe even sharper than my heartbreak with Kent.  I learned that getting physical so soon could be detrimental to something long-term, yet for some odd reason, I still had feelings for Connor.  But he didn't have those same kinds of feelings for me.  He did say that he had learned a lot from the dates he and I had been on.  Maybe he learned that getting physical too soon could confuse the head and the heart, just as much as it had mine.

April 7, 2023.  Ever since the day that Connor said he wasn’t interested in me anymore, I woke up feeling like absolute trash.  I had to tell myself several times in the morning that I could make it through another day.  My motivation and appetite decreased quite a bit.  I just had to let time pass to heal this one.

A couple days ago, Hyeji texted me saying that she had been struggling on an IS project and that she'd have to turn it in late.

```Hyeji: 😭😭😭😭😭```

```Me: Same```

```But in a different way```

```Hyeji: What do you mean?```

```Me: I'll have to tell you sometime later. In private.```

```Hyeji: What happened to you!!!!!!```

```Me: Oh, I better tell you in person lol```

```Maybe we can hang out sometime Friday night? What does your Friday look like?```

I actually had thought a bit about coming out to Hyeji.  She and I occasionally hung out during the semester, but we mostly studied together in the West View Building.

Today, she and I were in the stats lab in the afternoon.  We planned on getting food to eat, and I knew I needed to prepare myself to come out to her.  She finished her homework at almost 10pm.  Actually, around 9:30, I got a call from Christian.

“Hey, what’s up?” I answered.

“Hey, Michael!  What are you up to right now?”

“I’m just doing some homework with Hyeji.”  Christian and I talked for a bit before he handed the phone to Gyuna.

“Hey, there’s a Korean culture thing happening at the Wilk,” she said.  “We’re there right now.  What do you have going on?”

“I’m actually with Hyeji right now, and we’re about to go eat somewhere.”

“Oh, you’re with Hyeji?  Okay, bye.”  I heard Christian in the background telling Gyuna that I had asked what they were doing tomorrow.

“You can go!” Hyeji said.  But I had prepared myself to come out to her and didn’t want to miss the opportunity.

Hyeji and I decided to go to a new restaurant called Moyamo for a late dinner.  "So what did you want to talk to me about?" she asked as we were heading out of the West View Building.  I was surprised that she had remembered the topic and that she brought it up first.

I felt like it was the right thing to do.  We came across several people as we walked to Moyamo, so I was a bit scared.  "Hm... it’s not easy for me to say," I began.

"Well, does it involve other people?"

"Yeah."

"Were these people mean to you?  When did you start feeling this way?"

"It was Tuesday.  And uh, it wasn't intentional, but it still hurt.  I feel like I should just tell you directly instead of you trying to ask questions."  I took a deep breath.  We were walking by the Tanner Building, and all I could think about was Connor.  "So...  I like guys."  I waited for a bit to see her reaction.  She wasn't taken aback or shocked or anything like that, which was a bit of a surprise to me.  “Can you guess what I've been going through?"

"Did you get your heart broken?" she asked.

"... Yeah."

"Wow!  Michael!  I thought you didn't know what those kinds of feelings were like!  And I'm glad you were able to somewhat understand what I've been going through too with that one guy.  I've felt the same way, just heartbroken.  But I've been feeling better.  But how did you get your heart broken?"

"That's a really long story.  I don't know if you want to hear all of it."

"Oh, I do!" she said without hesitation.

So I basically had a two-hour storytelling session about how I felt when I came to BYU my freshman year and how I downloaded dating apps and matched with Connor and how I met him in person and how I had gotten into a relationship with Bryce and all of the complicated feelings I had and how I met Connor again.  "...And then on Tuesday, he and I talked, and he said he wasn't interested in going on dates with me anymore," I continued.  "I was able to keep my composure, but it still hurt a lot.  And when I went back to my apartment, I cried.  So I've been telling myself every morning that I can get through this day.  I have to tell that to myself out loud several times."

"Feeling heartbroken is a tough emotion," Hyeji said.  "What do you do to cope with it?"

"I've learned that being around people is really good for me.  Just being able to interact with others keeps my mind occupied.  And my love language is when people have conversations with me."

"Wow, Michael, you know, I'm not worried about you.  You're able to have conversations where you set expectations, and you know what you want.  And you're so popular!  You're still young, and you're a cute guy too, so you'll find someone.  I have no doubts about that.  But I have talked to a few of my friends about the Church.  I think there are many great things about the gospel, but I think one of the reasons why I've held back on baptism is how people in the Church view and treat people in the LGBTQ community.  I think those feelings are completely natural, whether you're straight or gay.  I have another friend who's lesbian, and she left the Church.  It was really sad to see her do that."

"I mean, I can kind of understand why people choose to do that, but it is sad that people choose that."

Hyeji and I walked to her apartment, and she made some ramen for us.  It was about 1am when I headed out the door.  Hyeji decided to walk me out too.

“That’s why you said you went to K’s Kitchen!” Hyeji exclaimed when I told her about my dates with Connor.

I laughed.  “I totally forgot I told you about that!”

“You said you were going with ‘a friend,’ but you were so vague about it.  Now it all makes sense!”
We continued to talk.  "How far are you going to walk?" I asked.

"Probably to the BYU sign.”

"Well, I guess by the time we part ways, I'm going to feel heartbroken all over again."

"You'll get over it for sure.  It takes time.  But I'm so proud of you, Michael!"  I never understood what people meant when they said they were "proud" of me.  First was Gyuna.  Then Cadee.  And now Hyeji.

"What are you proud of?" I asked.

"I'm proud that you're going on dates and trying to figure out your romantic life.  I thought you were a baby who didn't know what these feelings were.  But now I know that you're an adult, and you know what you want in a relationship.  Dang, I’m feeling inspired to download dating apps and start dating guys!"

I laughed.  "I do think Connor is a sweet guy.  I really do.  And I think deep down, he has good intentions.  But it sounds like he's had some not-so-great experiences with dating, and I think that's also influenced a lot of what he thinks and does.  He's been dating for about a year and a half, and a lot of the time, he says he doesn't know what he wants.  And I think I know why people say those kinds of people are red flags.  Even though he's really sweet, I think his indecisiveness is the reason why he hasn't been that successful finding someone to be in a relationship with.  Sometimes I'd get scared that he'd all of a sudden not feel interested, and I guess that was what happened.  And if he and I were to be in a relationship, I think his uncertainties would be detrimental in keeping a relationship moving forward.  But I still think he could be a friend.  I don't really know his friends, but for now, I just need some space so I can heal from these feelings before I reach out again."

"Yeah, that's a good idea."

Hyeji ended up walking me all the way back to my apartment, which was really sweet of her.  I also told her about how I needed to go shoe shopping, so she came with me.  She definitely was like Mom.  She went through a bunch of shoes and handed me shoe boxes one at a time for me to try on.  Then she’d put the ones that didn’t fit me back on the shelf.  She was also bold asking all of the workers where she could find shoes for me.  I finally found a pair that I liked and bought it.  It was so much more fun doing things with friends, and I was glad Hyeji was with me.

…

April 12, 2023.  Hyeji usually studied in one of the smaller lab rooms, and one of her classmates was sometimes there too.  I went to do homework with them.  After a couple hours, her classmate left.

“So how was the date yesterday?” Hyeji asked as soon as her classmate left.

I laughed.  I did go on a first date yesterday.  “It was pretty chill,” I said.  “We ate at Panda Express and then watched a TV show.”

“Why Panda Express?  I’d think a dinner date would be more like a sit-down restaurant.”

“Well, when you go on lots of dates, it gets pretty expensive.  Not that I’ve gone on multiple dates a week in a while.  But I’m pretty chill with going somewhere fast food.  As long as I’m in a setting where I can get to know the person, I’m fine with it.”

“You think you’d go on another date with him?”

“I’m pretty open.  I still feel like I don’t know him that well.  It’s hard to know someone just on a first date.”

“But what were your first impressions?”

“Well, he did summer sales when he was in college at BYU-I.  So, you know, I wasn’t sure if he’d be one of those arrogant salespeople.  But he’s pretty nerdy.  Definitely the opposite of what I thought.  He’s not the greatest at texting, but he talked a lot in person.  When I asked him if we could meet in person, I wasn’t sure how interested he was, but I think it went a lot better than I thought.  And I think he’s cute.”

After studying for another hour, Hyeji said, “Let’s turn on some music.”

“You want me to play music?” I asked.

“Yeah.”

“Oh.  Well, I don’t know much.”

I put on some Taylor Swift since my date yesterday was a Swiftie.  And it reminded me of Connor.

“Wow, you like Taylor Swift?” Hyeji asked.

“I’m getting used to it.  Connor liked Taylor Swift, and when I like someone—romantically or not—I want to get to know their interests.”  After listening to some of her songs, I didn’t realize how many of them were from her.  One of my friends from high school liked making fun of her songs because she was so dramatic.  I still thought she was really dramatic, but at least I could relate to how I’d gone on too many dates or how Connor’s face looked like my next mistake.

Hyeji recommended some other Taylor Swift songs.  It was fun and educational for me.

"You're a really good friend to me," she said.

"Aw thanks, you're a good friend to me too."

"I know,” she said casually.  “I know I'm a good friend to you, but I want you to know that you're a good friend to me."

We left around midnight and planned on studying for finals together.

…

April 15, 2023.  One of my roommates was a CS major, and he helped me a TON with my CS 236 projects.  I wanted to treat him to dinner as a thank-you, so he and I went to Itto Sushi.

It felt a bit weird.  Even though I had no romantic feelings for him and—as far as I knew—even though he was straight, all of the mechanics seemed like it was a date: planning on going out to dinner, having conversation, walking around the mall while waiting for our reservation.  Plus, I went to Itto Sushi on dates with Sam and Bryce, so that added to the confusion.  Now I began to question myself: what was the difference between hanging out with another guy and going on a date, especially a first date?  At least for most of my first dates, they felt the same as this occasion of simply taking my roommate to dinner.  I still didn’t get how guys knew from the first date if things weren’t going to work out.  I needed more time than just a first date.  So yeah, it was weird to come to that realization.

April 25, 2023.  Mom recently forwarded my itinerary for my flight to Guam and Dallas.  I was going to be leaving on April 27, so just in a couple days!  For the whole semester, I was excited to visit somewhere outside the country, but things leading up to the trip were a bit stressful.  Thankfully, the Atkins were willing to store my extra stuff in their basement, and they were SO accommodating for allowing me to stay with them between the time I’d finish my internship and the time that I could move back into my apartment.  I was going to have to help them with their yardwork or their horses or whatever they needed help with as a thank-you.

Finals were a lot more stressful than I thought.  For STAT 251 and STAT 386, each class had two-section finals.  One part was a coding portion, and that portion took me about 10+ hours to complete for both classes.  I didn’t expect to spend so much time trying to code.

Hyeji and I studied together in the West View Building for our STAT 340 final, which was my last and only in-class final.  We went over all the practice final questions together.  One thing that I liked about Hyeji was that even after coming out to her, she treated me the same.  I didn’t feel like my sexual orientation made me oddly stand out just as much as I didn’t feel like my race made me different in Kentucky.

When I finished the STAT 340 final, I was done with the semester!  Yay!  And I made all A’s that semester too.

…

I was surprised to get a call from Gyuna after I finished my final.  She messaged me asking when I’d leave for Guam, and I told her that I was going to be leaving Provo tomorrow.  Shari told me that I could stay at her place the night before I’d fly out.

“Why are you leaving so soon?” Gyuna asked.

“That’s what my itinerary says,” I answered.  “I actually don’t need to go to Rexburg to renew my vehicle registration since my parents said they’d take care of it online.”

“Well, I’m so busy with finals, but since you’ll be leaving tomorrow, are you available to meet today?”

I was surprised to hear that.  She and I hadn’t seen each other in person for over a month.  “I should be able to later tonight.  I’ll let you know when later.”

So I saw her at the Tanner Building late at night in one of the study rooms.  "You dyed your hair," I observed.  At first, I thought I had opened the wrong door.

"Oh yeah, it happened about a week ago," Gyuna said.  "I’m not happy with how it turned out though.  I want it to be white, but my hair grows really fast.  The roots are already growing out a lot."

She and I talked like normal, mostly about getting Japanese food at the Narita airport and Gyuna planning to apply to the Marriott business school.  "So I did want to talk about what had happened that one time when I got mad at you," she said.  "It seemed like you were pretty mad too, but what exactly were you mad about?"

It had been a while, so I had to think what exactly it was that made me not so happy.  "I wasn't really happy when you touched me, especially when you were being persistent," I answered.  "And then after that, when you ignored me, I wasn't really happy about that either because it sent a message to me that you didn't want to resolve the conflict and that you still wanted it to be an issue.  I did get defensive, and I really didn't mean to hurt you.  But I know I did."

Gyuna explained her side of the story, and I listened.  She talked about some of her past experiences and the reasons for her behavior.  "I know that I violated your space, and I know that different people are comfortable with different levels of touch," she continued.  "I'm working on that.  I feel like things may have surpassed our own boundaries, but I do need my physical touch.  So I think it's important to... what's the word..."

"Communicate?  I think there was a lack of communication."

"Yeah, that, but also negotiation."

"Well, I don't want to hurt you."

"Even for you, there's a certain level of physical touch you're okay with.  Like, when you get sad, you don't mind when I lean in and give a small hug."

"Yeah, cuz you're not creepy about it."

She laughed.  "Well, anyway.  I feel like we both should express an apology to each other.  I'm sorry that I kept touching you and violating you."

"Yeah, I'm sorry that I hurt you and that you might have felt helpless."

"Okay, this might sound like not much of a difference to you, but I want you to say that you're sorry that you punched me."

I didn't really get it.  "I'm sorry that I... punched you?"  It didn't sound sincere saying it the way she wanted to hear it.  It sounded like the same thing as apologizing for hurting her.

"When you say you're sorry for something you've done, it's something that you're in control of and something you won't do again.  Saying you're sorry because someone feels a certain way doesn't give a sense of responsibility or control for what you did."  I could understand that.  It made more sense.

"Well, I know it's not easy to communicate about these kinds of things, but I'm glad we could talk things out," I said.  "I think it's important that we're direct about things like this and that we can actually talk to each other about it."

"It's not tough trying to resolve things with you.  But it was tough telling you about my past experiences.  Christian suggested that he be there with us so that we wouldn't get extremely mad at each other.  But I know that this is the better way of doing things.  I did want to talk to you after a couple weeks, but then I got really sick.  And then you told me that you'll be leaving tomorrow, and I was like, 'Shoot, I need to talk to Michael TODAY.'"

Well, it wasn't surprising that things would happen last-minute, but at least it happened.

Gyuna and I walked to Don Joaquin since she wanted to eat some tacos.  "This reminds me of the time when we were walking on this road after my heartbreak with Kent," I said.

Gyuna laughed.  "I was thinking the exact same thing."

"Have you tried the new place Moyamo?  I went there with Hyeji a couple weeks ago.  Actually, I came out to her."

I noticed that Gyuna stopped walking.  She had a shocked expression on her face.  "You did?!  When?!"

"When she and I went to Moyamo.  It was about a couple weeks ago."

"How did that happen?  What made you come out to her?"

"She's been a good friend to me.  And she's been supportive and understanding.  Plus, she sometimes talks about this one guy that she's liked for a whole year, but it doesn't sound like he treats her well, so I'm not sure why she's still into him."

"Oh, so it's gotta be the same guy from back in November then."

"Oh yeah, I guess she did talk about him when we went to Feast Buffet.  But when I came out to her and told my story, she said she feels motivated to start dating.  She has an internship in DC, and she plans on using Tinder or some dating app while she's there to go on dates.  I guess I inspired her."

Gyuna ate her tacos, and I updated her on my dating life.  Of course, I didn't tell her about Connor because I knew she'd call me out for it.  "I think I'm going to take a dating hiatus," I continued.  "Definitely while I'm in Guam.  Not sure about Texas, but I probably won't date there either.  I'll just try to get to know my roommates, and hopefully I'll vibe with them."

"You'll be so lonely in Guam though," Gyuna said.  "Plus, you probably won't be in Guam again, so you should try going on dates!"

"But nothing's going to last long-term.  I'll be there for just a month.  Same kind of thing with Texas.  That reminds me, I've been reaching out to some people if they want me to send them my reflection, so I texted Kent."

"Really?!  What did he say?"

"He was like, 'Sounds great!' and gave me his email address.  I have no idea what he's up to these days.  I also asked Bryce too."

"Have you talked to him?"

"We've texted each other a few times, but that's about it.  He says he wants to read my reflection to know what I think of him.  And I texted him happy birthday on his birthday."

"Oh shoot,” Gyuna exclaimed.  “I totally forgot about his birthday.  And it's not like I have his number either.  And the only way I was able to talk to him was when I saw him with you."

"Yeah.  Well, he said he doesn't want to be friends and that he doesn't want to see me, at least intentionally.  That's his choice."

"It's probably for the better honestly.  But are you going to talk about how you made out with guys?"

"I mean, not in full description.  But yeah, I'll be like, 'We made out.'"

Gyuna looked shocked again.  "Dang, Michael!  You're so unimaginable, so unpredictable.  Like, you're not open with your family, but you're also so open.  If I were to tell my mom that I made out with Christian, she'd send me back home.  If I were a missionary, she'd be like, 'Sister Bak, you're getting sent home.'"  It wasn't like straight people didn't know what making out was like, right?

After Gyuna finished eating, we were about to part ways.  "Well, I guess we'll see each other in... when?  Fall semester?"

"Yeah, in like September," Gyuna said.  "That's like four or five months.  But let me know when you get to Guam.  And eat some good food at the Narita airport."  She gestured for a hug.  "Let's give each other a hug before we leave."  So I gave her a one-arm hug.  And she wasn't creepy about hugging me, so I felt better about that.

"Good to see you," I said.

"Good to see you too."  And with that, we parted ways.

April 27, 2023.  Today was the day!  Early that morning, David drove me to the airport.

As I reflected on the past school year, I realized I went through so much that I didn’t expect.  At the beginning of the school year, I thought my life would just consist of studying at the LSB every day like the previous school year.  But I met so many amazing people and had so many amazing experiences as I went out of my way to date guys.  And now I was planning on writing my story to my family.  How was I going to express the roller coaster of emotions I had experienced this past school year?  That question was on my mind as I boarded the plane to my temporary home.

_(May 2021; end of my mission) I was still an office elder in Bellevue and had about a week left on my mission._

_One of the zone leaders told my companion, Elder Candari, that he had broken up with his girlfriend.  Elder Candari seemed to make a big deal about it trying to comfort our zone leader.
“I don’t get why people do that to themselves,” I said.  “Why do people choose to do that and then get sad?”_

_Elder Candari didn’t answer that question.  He probably got hints that I had never had a romantic life and couldn’t empathize with the situation.  I obviously didn’t know that such a thing would happen to me not even two years later._

…

_Elder Candari and I were teaching a 92-year-old convert named Brian.  We went to his house twice a week to teach lessons, and he always treated us to hot chocolate.  It was so much fun getting to see him._

_We were preparing for him to receive his endowment.  The Seattle temple was still limited in what could go on due to COVID, but I was able to attend the session.  It had been nearly a year and a half since I last went to the temple._

_It was a spiritually enriching experience.  As the small group of us got to the celestial room, we all gave Brian a hug._

_“This is why I’m a missionary,” Elder Candari said as he gazed at the chandelier.  “There’s no way I could become less active.”_

_I felt the same way.  Exaltation was the goal, and it so was refreshing to remember that._

…

_May 30, 2021.  “It’s the end of an era,” Elder Candari said._

_It really did feel like the end of an era.  I had been an office elder for the past ten months.  It was nearing 9pm, and we were about to head back to the apartment for the night._

_It would be my last trip from the office back to the apartment.  I had taken that route countless times, even before I was transferred to Bellevue: the speed bumps, the left turn at the signal onto 12th Street, the scenic view of the highway.  It was weird._

_I was a little nervous about not waking up early enough to get to the airport on time, but I was able to get out of bed without much trouble the next day—May 31, 2021._

_It was weird when I got on the plane.  I was flying to Salt Lake City and then taking a connecting flight to Idaho Falls.  I couldn’t believe that I was actually leaving.  Two years felt so long in the moment, but now that I was finished, it felt like such a blur._

_When I got off the plane in Idaho Falls, I was surprised to see Shari and David waving at me from afar.  I didn’t expect them to show up.  After I retrieved my luggage, I got to see Mom and Dad and gave them hugs._

_It was about a half-hour drive to Rexburg, and my stake president—whom I had never met before—was waiting for me at the stake center.  All of us were in his office, and I shared a few experiences and bore my last testimony as a full-time missionary._

_After I bore my testimony, the stake president said, “Well, Elder, you are officially released and will promise not to wear your name badge in public anymore.  You’re allowed to take it off now.”_

_I took a look at my Korean name tag.  Although I had taken off my name tag every night before going to bed, it was so sentimental realizing that I was going to be taking my name tag off for the very last time as a full-time missionary.  I thought about my companions.  I thought about the people I had taught.  I thought about the excitements, the discouragements, the office, studying Korean, tracting after dark, COVID, just a flood of memories.  As I took off my name tag, I couldn’t help but break down in tears.  Even though the mission was one of the most difficult things I had done, I was for a moment so sad that it was the end of an era.  It was a reconfirmation that serving a mission really was worth it._

If you’ve read this far into my reflection, I thank you for the time you’ve read it.  I know it’s a LOT.

So why did I think that sharing this very long story was the right way for me to come out?  And why is coming out such a big deal in the first place?  When someone genuinely admits, "I'm gay," it's so much more than having feelings for the same gender.  It's difficult to sit down and articulate everything in one sitting.  That's why I've turned to writing.  My experience of dating guys isn't every gay person’s experience, much like how straight people go through different dating experiences, but mine is just a glimpse of what it's like to be gay (and Asian) at BYU.  It's tough, especially when everyone around me is talking about dating and marriage and how much they want it.  When I began dating guys, that was when I saw that I wanted those things too.  Many gay guys have told me that their dating experiences haven’t been that great, so I feel fortunate to feel like my experiences have been good overall.  Not all of them have been good, but I feel like I’ve had an overall positive experience.

As much as I hope that each of you—my family members—will support me and respect my decision to date guys, I know that your choice is out of my control.  For those who do support me or even have a desire to know my future dating life or have questions about my past experiences, I'd be happy to listen, as I still have questions of my own.

If you don't support my decisions, I will find those who will support me.  I'm so glad for the support I've received from especially Gyuna and Christian this past school year.  I feel that their support has helped me navigate my own feelings and has helped me avoid situations that could've taken me down a bad path.  I know that the kind of life I want to live may not be the kind of life that you saw for my future, and I can sort of understand that.  I used to think that I'd marry a girl, but I've learned that marriage is more than a mechanical matter.  Maybe it might sound weird for a heterosexual couple to think that the kind of love and the chemicals that are released are the same for a gay couple, but that's my reality.  And I'd imagine that the same kind of aversion that I feel towards a relationship with a girl would be the same feeling of aversion that a straight person would feel towards a same-sex relationship.

Also of note, the names of all the guys I’ve dated or who are gay are not their actual names.  I do that mostly to keep people safe, which might sound weird.  The gay community is very small and vulnerable, so I don’t want to “out” someone intentionally.  I want to respect that some people may not be comfortable being publicly out.  It’s not an easy thing to do.  So yes, Gyuna’s boyfriend’s name is Christian, but no, my ex’s name is not Bryce.  If you had read Tate’s blog story, you probably noticed that the author's name is not Tate.  I don’t know if anyone would’ve caught onto that.

When Mom, Dad, and I were in Palau, they asked me if I had been going on dates.  I wasn’t ready to come out at that point.  They probably still stuck to their definition of a “date”: when a guy and a girl plan to do something together and then do it.  I was curious about what they felt about dating, not merely their definition.  I decided to ask the questions I used to ask in my atheist days.  “Why is it important to date?” I asked.

“In the gospel, what ordinances and covenants do we make so that we can live with Heavenly Father?” Mom asked.

Per the usual, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, the priesthood, the endowment…  “And marriage,” I said.

“Yeah.  Dating is a step towards marriage.”

“But marriage is just an ordinance.  I don’t have to date someone in order to get married.  So why do I need to date someone?”

“It’s important that you get to know different girls,” Dad answered.

“Why do I need to get to know different girls in order to marry?” I asked.

“Because everyone is different.  You’ll find that there are some things that you like and other things that you don’t like.  Men and women are very different.  When men find a girl to be attractive, it’s usually love at first sight, more about appearance.  For women, they feel attracted to a guy on a more emotional level.  I needed a woman like Mom.  I just needed someone who’d be okay if we were quiet for 20 minutes.  I had a friend when I was young who’d always hang out with me, and he was totally okay if there was silence for 20 minutes.”

“So that’s why you married Mom?” I asked.

“Partly.  I’m a boring man.  I needed someone who would be okay with that.”

I guess that explained where my boring-man genes came from.

“Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses,” Dad continued.  “We’re not a very expressive family.  I think one of the reasons why people have a hard time talking to Mom is because she doesn’t open up.  And our children are like that, times two.  I used to be that way too.  I was really shy talking to girls.”

“What about talking to guys?”

“I think I just had a hard time talking to people in general.  But now after all the church callings I’ve had, they got me out of my comfort zone, and I had to talk to people.  I’ve become a lot better and more confident.  But when you’re interested in a girl, if you were to go on a date, you’d have to ask her.”

“Why would I be interested in her?”

“Maybe because she’s nice.”  That could’ve been a potential reason I’d date a guy.

“Why are there some people who say no to a date?” I asked.

“Well, some people may not feel comfortable.  Maybe the guy just wants to kiss, and the girl doesn’t want that.  But when you ask a girl on a date, most will say yes.”

“Why is it convention that a guy asks the girl?  Why can’t the girl ask the guy?”

“Girls can ask guys out.  But I guess it’s not the standard.  You shouldn’t expect girls to ask you out.”

“So...  Marriage is more than just a ceremony?  You have to feel a certain way about someone?”

Both Mom and Dad nodded.  Well, I guess they weren’t as mechanical as I thought they were.  It sounded like they knew what romantic love was.  Maybe they’d have a level of understanding of my situation.  Or maybe they wouldn’t and would act like privileged straight people.  Either way, there was something that they should’ve been happy about.  If they were more mechanical when it came to emotions, then all the times when I was with Gyuna and Hyeji would’ve fit Mom and Dad’s definition of a date.  I definitely went on countless “dates” with them.  But if Mom and Dad had some compassion, then maybe they’d see how much I had emotionally grown from dating guys.  And I knew that I’d have to be patient with them, just as it took me a long time for me to accept my reality.

Taking a dating hiatus was honestly pretty nice.  I've had a lot of time to ponder and reflect this past school year about my dating life.  Even though a long-term relationship is the goal, I think I want to find friends for now—friends who will be good influences on me.  The beginnings of friendship and dating are very similar from my experiences: figuring out if the other person would be a good fit.  Both parties involved had to desire and maintain that friendship and reciprocate, much like a long-term relationship.  Maybe a friendship level was more of what I had been perceiving than a long-term relationship when I went on first dates.  But one thing I feel is different about friendships than dating is that friendships can last, even if there is no romantic interest.  With long-term relationships, it seems like if either person doesn’t find romantic interest, then that’s the end.  Plus, I feel like it’s normal for people to be friends before they become couples.

I think trying to find friends will be just as difficult as finding a long-term relationship.  Making friends has always been difficult for me, especially at BYU.  People like Gyuna and Paige have liked me for my qualities and character, not merely because of my intelligence, talent, or Dad's "status" in the Church.  I've also found that it takes time for me to feel an emotional connection with a romantic interest, and I think other people would need just as much time to realize that I'm more than just my race.  I'm obviously not perfect, but I feel like I don't have shallow character like so many guys complain about.  I think that if I had the appearance of a white person, I'd have a larger network, which would mean more opportunities, which would also mean more power.  Not that I'm power-hungry, but I feel like connecting with people would be so much easier.

Being marginalized is not an unfamiliar feeling.  It's how I've felt looking like an Asian at BYU.  Sexual orientation isn't always as apparent as someone's race, but I do wonder what people's perception of me would be if people in my ward knew I was gay.  I've heard stories of bishops saying that being gay is an abomination or that people shouldn't associate with the gays.  I thought that such comments were dramatic and exaggerated, but now I can see how that could be some people's unfortunate reality.

Dad was a stake president throughout my middle school and high school years.  I often felt like people liked me and wanted to get to know me merely because I was "the stake president's son."  Looking in retrospect, I could've taken advantage of Dad's title by networking with people, but I wondered if people would've treated me the same if Dad wasn't a stake president or a bishop or any calling.  I didn't think that would've been the case, at least attending YSA wards at BYU.  I didn't openly tell people that my parents were mission president and wife, and they probably wouldn't have cared much anyway since Dad had no direct involvement with the wards I attended.  But it was sickening to think that people would've had a different perception of me if Dad didn't have such a title.  The pattern probably would've been the same with Mom.

As for now, like I stated previously, I will try to find some friends, hopefully those in the gay community.  My experiences primarily with Sam, Connor, and Bryce have made me re-evaluate my dating goals.  I'm glad that Sam and I didn't jump into a relationship and that we were able to communicate our values.  I feel like my skepticism has made me want to date a guy a bit longer if I do have a romantic interest.

I did reach out to Connor, and I’m honestly glad he told me no to a relationship now.  Not only do I think he doesn’t know what he wants, but he isn’t the person I knew when I first met him.  I do feel sad about it.  I hope that I can find someone who likes me for who I am and not just for my body.  I can’t believe that I didn’t notice that red flag when he asked me to make out with him and then to tell me that he was looking for a long-term relationship after I said no to making out.  It makes me feel so dumb.  I think fetishizing is just as shallow as someone not being interested in me simply because of my race; neither one wants to get to know me as an actual person.

With Bryce, I think I've learned that it's okay not to rush into a relationship.  It's easier to say that now than back then since I really, really wanted to know what being in a long-term relationship was like.  I think it would've been better to have said no to a relationship, mostly for his sake.  And if a guy isn't patient enough to take things slow, then he probably wouldn't be right for me.  We’d have to be on the same page about stuff like that.

I also hope I can learn how to find a balance between the head and the heart.  On one end, I don't want to be dating someone who reminds me of dating a girl.  But on the other end, I don't think that dating someone means that I'll always feel butterflies or that this guy is constantly on my mind.  I've heard from many people about how building a relationship takes effort.  That was how I viewed my relationship with Bryce.  He might have thought that a relationship was supposed to always be more on the feelings side to the point that he didn't realize he had feelings for me until he let go.  So this balancing act is another thing I'll have to figure out.

Being in the LDS community, the gay community, and the Asian community is a very weird triangle to be in.  Being religious and Asian are part of the Minority in the gay community, and being gay and Asian are part of the Minority of the LDS community, at least at BYU.  I can especially see the LDS and gay communities ask, “Why are you in both?  Aren’t they opposites?”

One of my favorite scripture passages is when Christ taught what the great commandment was.  To give context, a Pharisee had intentions of “testing” or confounding Christ by asking what the number one commandment to follow was.  The Pharisees were a group of people known for strict obedience to the letter of the law.  The story is found in Matthew 22:36-39:

36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

38 This is the first and great commandment.

39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

It’s a well-known passage.  What I love about it is the paradox between what a commandment is and this particular commandment itself.  Most people think of commandments as dos and don’ts.  In this particular commandment, the thing to do is to love God and our neighbors.  The paradox is that loving someone, romantically or not, isn’t a mechanical matter.

I’ve often thought about how cool it would be if an algorithm existed where two parties could get along with each other, no matter their backgrounds, personalities, and perspectives.  Those two parties could be as small as two individuals or as large as two nations.  As I’ve dated guys, I’ve realized that such an algorithm is next to non-existent.  Yes, there are ways to show love, but that’s only a starting point.  Two people can do or say the very same thing yet have completely opposite intentions.  I think feelings are what make us human.  For me, I often try to understand another person’s intentions.  I feel like most people don’t have malicious intentions; they may simply not know better, or they may have different experiences.  Going back to what Christ taught, He probably confounded that Pharisee for only going through the motions and not the emotions or the intentions of the commandments.  Again, loving someone isn’t a mechanical matter.

As I had stated in an earlier chapter, I think it’s difficult for someone to empathize what it’s like to have a spiritual experience or what it’s like to be gay unless that person experiences AND acknowledges it.  I often think about a world where feelings don’t matter.  Marriage would simply be a ritual: have an XX-chromosome being and an XY-chromosome being go through the motions of the ceremony, just as God commands.  But what happens if the couple realizes that they can’t have children?  The logical thing to do would be to divorce each other, and if one of the spouses is fertile, he or she would find someone else who isn’t infertile so that they can keep the commandment to multiply and replenish the earth.  The hope is for the infertile to die out of society so that they wouldn’t burden the fertile.  Maybe divorce sounds harsh, but it’s like marriage; a divorce is another ritual where an XX-chromosome being and an XY-chromosome being break off their marriage.

I don’t know what it’s like for a couple to dream of having children and to realize that it isn’t possible, but I would think that such an experience can bring the couple even closer together through their love for each other as they face that harsh reality.  We’re taught that couples who can’t have children in this life can have that blessing in the next life.  I think that promised blessing gives couples hope, even when others may judge or ridicule those couples for not having children.  And even though those couples won’t actually see that they can have children until after this life, their hope drives them.

Similarly, I feel that sort of hope when it comes to faith and sexuality.  Even though I don’t know how gay people fit into the plan of salvation, I have hope that God does have a plan for me—that maybe there’s an inkling of hope that I CAN be with my family after this life.  I know that there are people out there who marginalize gay people and who tear down their faith by telling them that their life isn’t right, that they’re “threats” or “attackers” to the family, or that they don’t have a place in the celestial kingdom, and I can sort of understand why gay members of the Church leave for those reasons.  Living a life of faith isn’t easy.  But I’m doing what I can to have faith, just as I’m sure black members of the Church in the 1950s faced a similar faith crisis pertaining to their exaltation.

I'm grateful for the experiences and the people I've met this past school year.  I know that God knows the details of our lives.  Sometimes He may seem silent, but for me, it means trusting that He trusts me and will direct me otherwise.  And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.
