## Section 1

October 29, 2022.  “Moshi moshi?” I got a call from Gyuna.

“Moshi moshi,” Gyuna greeted in her Japanese voice.  “What are you planning on doing for the rest of the day?”

“I’ve got homework to do.  But… I’m thinking that I’ll go to FHE.  You know, I need to get to know my FHE group better.  It’ll be good for me.  Are you going to be on campus tonight?”

“Yeah, I plan on being here until probably 11.”

“Okay, I’ll try to meet you after FHE, so probably around 8:30.”

“Cool, I’m at the Wilk in the Cougareat.”

Well, I did plan on going to FHE with my roommates.  But while I was using the bathroom, my roommates ditched me, and I was kind of scared going to FHE by myself.  So I called Gyuna and told her that I was on my way to campus.

“Your roommates ditched you?” Gyuna asked when I explained the situation.

“Yeah,” I answered.  “I’m not that close to them though.”

“But they’re your roommates.  And it’s FHE.”

I shrugged.  “I’ve learned that the title of ‘roommate’ doesn’t mean that they’re my friends.”

“Well, that’s kind of sad.  I mean, obviously, I don’t go to FHE either.  Sometimes it can be awkward.”

“It’s better when you go with friends, but I don’t have any friends, and I don’t make any.  I don’t know why it’s so hard to make friends.”

“Uh.  You have me,” Gyuna said.  “Bro, so many people know you here on campus.”  She did see me say hi to people I recognized.

I shrugged again.  “They’re not necessarily my friends.  I don’t hang out with them like I do with you.”

After some conversation, Gyuna said she was pretty stressed out.  She seemed pretty stressed out about school, but this time, she talked about her friends from Rexburg and especially Christian.  “I wish he was more financially reliable,” she continued.  “When we eat out, he’s always like, ‘Uh, can you pay for our meal?  I’m broke and spent so much money coming down to Provo to see you.’  With my previous boyfriend, he’d try to pay for EVERYTHING.  And a good girl will make sure that he doesn’t pay for everything all the time.  Even though I was in high school and didn’t have that much money, I’d tell him, ‘No, I can pay for my own.’  But with Christian, almost every time, I pay for myself AND for his stuff.  He and I have had this conversation a few times, and it’s been one of the things that has seriously made me consider breaking up with him.  Yes, there are great things about Christian.  He’s very emotionally aware of me and helps me fulfill that aspect, but this financial reliability has been such an issue.  I told him that he should get a job, and I’ve tried helping him find jobs.  I even referred him at my call center job during the summer.  But he says that he doesn’t have time for a job.  It’s just been so frustrating.  Like, I don’t want to be picky down to the penny about who’s paid how much, but if someone does something nice for me, I’ll do something nice for them in return.  It’s usually a meal or something along those lines.  Americans don’t seem to care about stuff like that.  They’re just like, ‘Venmo me.’  Like, bro, that’s all they care about.”

Gyuna had ranted to me like this a few times before.  I figured out that all I needed to do was listen.  I didn’t have to say a thing, which was nice.  Honestly, I didn’t feel qualified to say anything.  I didn’t get why the guy was expected to pay for the girl’s stuff either.  Wasn’t that sort of condescending, like she wasn’t independent enough to pay for her own meal or merchandise?

Gyuna also ranted about how her Halloween weekend plans were ruined due to some miscommunication, so she wasn’t sure what she was going to do now.  She ranted for about an hour.  “Hey, I have this donut that I bought here.  You want it?”  She handed the bag over.

“Uh…  You don’t want it?” I asked.

“You can have it.  I know you want it because you didn’t immediately say no.  See?  You listened to me rant for an hour, and I’m giving this donut to you because of your patience.”

I had gotten texts from Christian asking if Gyuna was okay.  I showed them to her.  It sounded like she wasn’t texting him or taking his calls.  “Why do girls do that?” I asked her.

She rolled her eyes.  “Bro, just tell him that I’ve been kinda sad today and that you saw me for a few hours.”

Gyuna and I headed to the fourth floor of the library to do some homework.  Well, more like getting distracted by the two of us having a conversation.  “You need to get yourself a lover!” Gyuna exclaimed in the middle of our conversation.  “Then you’ll understand why Christian and I touch each other so much.”

“I just don’t find it appealing,” I said.  “I mean, I guess it’s a way to show people that the couple is in a relationship and that others shouldn’t try pursuing a relationship with either of them.”

“Bro, it’s a natural thing for a couple to want to touch each other.  It’s not just for show.  What are you going to do when you have a wife and are trying to have children?”

“I mean, I’ll obviously have to touch her,” I answered.  “But other than that, I wouldn’t be intentional about touching her.”

“If Christian never touched me, I’d run away from him.  I’d immediately break up with him.  I would never want a relationship like that.”

But why?  I didn’t get it.  I guess it was very essential that Gyuna found someone who fulfilled her love language.

“Again, you’ll just need to find a girl you really like and want to be in a relationship with.”

I was a little nervous talking about this.  I hadn’t told Gyuna about how I had recently downloaded dating apps.  I wasn’t sure what she’d think of me.

...

October 29, 2022.  Christian ended up coming down to Provo again.  It sounded like he and Gyuna had talked things out and were doing just fine now.

For about the past couple weeks, Gyuna and Christian were talking about going to a haunted house up in Salt Lake City.  They asked me if I could give them a ride up there, but I was a bit hesitant about it.  I hadn’t driven up to Salt Lake ever since Mom and Dad gave me the minivan, so I was pretty nervous about driving.  Plus, it looked like the haunted house wasn’t too far from one of the train stations, so they could’ve taken that.  They also wanted to go to some hot springs, but things ended up getting cancelled.  I learned that even if I wanted to do stuff with friends, it would be better for me not to be as stingy with my money.  Of course, watching the way Gyuna and Christian spend their money wasn’t an example to me, but if I wanted to spend time with them—which I wanted—then I had to be willing to make some sacrifices.

Gyuna asked me to take my car with me, so I did.  The three of us planned on going to a corn maze up in West Jordan, so that was where we went.

“Wow, so bougie, Michael,” Gyuna said when she got in the car.

“What scares you about driving?” Christian asked.

“Just getting into an accident,” I answered.  “And parking is horrendous here.  It’s like I have to compete to get street parking.”

There was a regular corn maze and a haunted corn maze, and I obviously just went to the regular maze.  Gyuna had invited one of her other friends who was up in Salt Lake City, so she came as well.  The four of us went through the regular maze first, and then the three of them went to the haunted maze.

Before they went, the four of us took a break to get something to eat.  I knew Gyuna complained a lot about financial reliability, but they would spend SO much money every weekend.  I had to stop to think how much they had spent today.  One of the mazes was 22 dollars per person, and the other was 10 per person.  They might have gotten a discount for doing both, so I was going to say 50 dollars.  Then they spent more money on fries, fried Oreos, and a caramel apple, so I was going to say another 10 dollars.  Then they spent money on In 'N Out, which they spent like 13 dollars there.  So that was at least 73 dollars that they spent.  That was so much!  At the beginning of the semester, I lowered my socializing budget to 20 dollars a month because I didn't think I'd have a social life like last school year.  But obviously, that changed.

Even though plans changed a lot for Gyuna and Christian’s Halloween, I was glad that they tried to include me.  I felt like everyone had a good time.

...

October 30, 2022.  As far as my dating app adventures, I tried all kinds to see what they were like.  Eventually, I felt like Tinder and Hinge were my most comfortable dating apps to use.  A lot of people used those apps, and I could message people for free.  I could also see if the person smoked cigarettes, drank, smoked weed, or did drugs.  I knew that I didn’t want any of those, so they were good ways to narrow down my options.  I decided to go with what my “feelings” told me and tried to find people I thought looked attractive.  (For those who aren’t familiar with dating apps, people show up one at a time with pictures and a bio.  Swiping left means you’re not interested, swiping right means you’re interested, and a match means that both you and the person you swiped right on also swiped right.)

My first match ever occurred on Hinge with someone named <span style="color:red">Connor</span>.
I was really surprised that he and I matched because I thought he was really cute!  For some reason, I had in mind that I would never see myself going on a date with someone cute.  But I was pretty nervous.  I couldn’t believe that I was doing this in order to go on dates.

I still didn’t know what a “date” even was, especially differentiating it from a hangout.  Mom and Dad told me that a date was when a guy and a girl planned to do something and then actually do it.  I guess their definition of a date was unapplicable if I was planning to do something with a guy.  But at least for the time being, if I was going to actually meet this guy in person and do something, it would’ve been a date to me.

I wasn’t sure how to start the conversation with Connor.

```Me: Hey what’s up man?```

```Connor: Hey! I’m just working right now. How are you?```

We exchanged a few lines over the course of a few days.  I learned that he was also at BYU and was studying information systems.

Online was nice in some ways, but I wasn’t a fan of texting.  It was hard to read people and get a sense of their personality.  I preferred asking questions in person to get to know someone better.  I felt like if I were to ask a bunch of questions over text, then it would be hard to know what else to ask if I were to meet in person.  But I didn’t want to rush things.  I wasn’t sure what was considered “conventional” as far as how long I should text someone before meeting in person.

I searched the Internet, and it said about two to three days.  Connor and I hadn’t texted each other too much, as school and research were pretty busy for me, and I was sure he was busy with stuff too.  But I had the courage to ask to meet in person.

```Me: We should do something together. I’m pretty new to this online thing, so I prefer getting to know people in person. Plus I think you’re kinda cute ;) If you don’t feel comfortable, I understand. But we could do something low key like a hike or ice cream or even just a chat. Thoughts?```

I realized that for the first time in my life, I just flirted with someone.  It was low key, but now I understood why President Beardall said that elders and sisters were not to flirt with each other.  It roused feelings of attraction, and that was a big no-no on the mission.  I didn’t understand what “flirting” was because it seemed like even as simple as having a conversation with a sister could’ve been a possible accusation of flirting.  Everyone said that one could tell if he or she was flirting, and I guess that was true.  I didn’t know what flirting was until this moment.

It wasn’t until later the next day when Connor responded.

```Connor: Hey sorry for a slow response. I’d be down sometime for sure!!```

I mostly wanted to get to know him and what his dating life was like being at BYU.  It must have been hard.  Ever since I downloaded dating apps, I felt so vulnerable on campus.  I guess in some ways, I already did feel vulnerable for looking like an Asian, but this kind of vulnerability was different.  What if I happened to walk past Connor without even knowing it?  Or what if there were other guys at BYU who had seen my profile and I didn’t know it?  I was usually not wary of my surroundings, but now, I was pretty alert.

```Me: Cool! Any suggestions on where to get ice cream? When would you be available? I’m pretty open later in the evenings on the weekdays this week and am pretty open Friday evening and Saturday.```

```Also… I haven’t come out to anyone, not even to my closest friends or family. So I just want to be honest and let you know that I’m sorta nervous. But I think it’s a good kind of nervous! Plus I haven’t gone on a date since before my mission, so it’s been about three years or so.```

```Connor: Hmm idk, Culver’s has great custard! We could go there?```

```And hey that’s awesome man!! Glad you’re kinda feelings things out and everything. And I totally get feeling nervous, I totally get it. No need to be nervous around me though!```

I turned off notifications from the dating apps, as I felt very uncomfortable if someone were to notice that I was getting those kinds of notifications.  So I gave Connor my number, and he texted me.  He said he was really busy this week but that we could maybe do something next week.  I was still a bit skeptical about setting something up and then getting cancelled on.  I felt like he was trying to skip out on me, but I told him that once he figured things out to let me know.

```Connor: Sounds good! So where are you from?```

I was expecting he would say something like “sounds good” and then never text me back, so I was surprised he asked me a question.  After some more texting, I found out that he served a mission in Sapporo, Japan!  I felt like people who served missions in Japan were a bit more understanding towards people like me.

But wow, he served a mission too?  And he was at BYU?  And he sounded smart.  And he was kinda cute and seemed nice!  Wow, what the heck?  I didn’t know there were guys at BYU who were in a similar boat as me.

_(August 2020; 14 months into my mission) It was the beginning of a new transfer.  I was pretty excited about what being an office elder would be like.  The morning of transfers, Sister Beardall called and asked if I could be at transfers half an hour early._

_I wasn’t sure what to expect.  I noticed that the current office elders had boxes and envelopes, and they also had signs with all of the names of the zones.  At the end of the transfer meeting, all of the missionaries would drive out in a line while Sister Beardall handed out treats and such.  She wanted me to be in charge of asking all of the missionaries if they were going to be picking up a missionary at the airport and delivering supplies.  There were 60 incoming missionaries that transfer, which was the highest number of missionaries that were coming into the mission in a single transfer while I was a missionary.  Not only that, but several areas were getting whitewashed.  It was an incredibly chaotic transfer.  My new companion’s name was Elder Walker.  For some reason, the previous office elder didn’t help out, so I wanted to try to be as much help as I could.  A couple of tables were set up, and envelopes were EVERYWHERE.  Missionaries were asking left and right about which keys to pick up.  I didn’t know how things were organized, so I was just a sitting duck until the missionaries started to file out._

_I handed out a bunch of stuff to different missionaries while they filed out.  Once everyone was out of the place, we cleaned everything up.  I was exhausted.  I didn’t realize how much stuff went on with transfers._

...

_Bellevue was the city of my new area.  It was extremely rich.  The area I covered included Bill Gates’ house.  Sometimes we saw people walking in the park with full-on tuxedos or prom dresses for no reason.  People were a lot more cautious about COVID than in my previous area, a small town called Enumclaw._

_The nice thing about being an office elder was that we got to be in the office basically every weekday.  It was such a repose from the world.  The way the office functioned changed quite a lot during my time in the office, but at the beginning of my time there, it was just us and one senior couple.  We had extra responsibilities, which I really enjoyed learning the things that went on behind the scenes.  Again, I felt more informed about what was going on in the mission, and it motivated me to do both office and missionary work._

_We still weren’t able to knock on doors, which was totally fine by me.  However, the Bellevue stake president said that he didn’t want members to be visiting each other in person, which was definitely different from Enumclaw.  In Enumclaw, I visited members in person all the time.  I knew that spending time with members was sort of looked down upon, but I honestly felt like trying to get to know the members was actually a good use of time, especially when we didn’t have that many options anyway.  I did feel like Bellevue was pretty different though.  It definitely had more of a city vibe, and it was sort of hard to connect with the members initially.  But we did have a lesson with the bishop during the first week of the transfer._

_After the lesson, the bishop told us about a family that used to be next-door neighbors before he moved.  He said their names were Joseph and Radha.  He felt like they would be okay if we knocked on their door.  They had met in Salt Lake City, and it sounded like they knew a bit about the Church.  So that was what we did._

_The first few times we knocked, no one answered, but after about a couple weeks, we were able to meet the father, Joseph.  He was super nice and told us he was busy with studying some medical exams, but he said that we could come back in another three weeks.  So we made sure to put in a contact attempt for him in our area book._

_Three weeks passed, and we visited Joseph and Radha again.  We were able to set up a lesson with them, and during that lesson, we taught the Restoration.  They were some of the nicest people I had met on my mission.  They were so courteous, and they gave us food too.  It felt like being in a restaurant in Japan; that was how respectful they were._

_California was having some crazy fires, which affected a lot of the US, including the Seattle area.  It looked like regular Seattle weather with its gray skies, but the gray came from the smoke.  However, we still sat outside in Joseph and Radha’s backyard, socially distanced with our masks on.  It was one of the most powerful Restoration lessons I had taught on my mission.  They were so attentive, and we bore powerful testimony.  After the lesson, Radha told us that she was going to have a barbecue with the bishop and his wife, and she wanted to invite us to it as well.  I was excited!  Maybe it would be our opportunity to teach them more about the gospel.  They seemed so solid, and having the bishop and his wife as fellowship was going to be amazing._

...

_It had been about six months since I stopped taking medication.  I felt like I was adjusting and that I didn’t need to be dependent on those drugs.  However, by the beginning of September, I started to feel my mental health decline.  Honestly, I started to feel it decline by the end of my time in Enumclaw, but I was going strong.  It was definitely not easy to get out of bed in the mornings, but without fail, I always rose from bed at 6:30.  But something was definitely off._

_The office really was a nice repose.  We didn’t have 5 to 7 finding like we did pre-COVID.  We usually were in the office from 1 to 5 anyway.  But for some reason, even with the office duties and the limitations on our finding methods, I began to feel super anxious.  We still had lessons in the evenings, but even thinking about them didn’t make me feel good._

_By the middle of the transfer, sometimes I felt like I was fighting breath by breath.  I also noticed that I was losing weight really fast.  Another side effect of the medication was that I gained weight.  Ironically, if I didn’t eat well, I would start feeling depressed.  Ever since I started taking my medication, I wasn’t able to do the regular 24-hour fast, not if I still wanted to be able to do missionary work._

_I tried to cope with the anxiety and depression with the Calm app.  Every morning, I played a session to calm my nerves.  Before our planning session at 8:30, I usually lied on the ground and played some music._

_But my mental health continually declined.  By the middle of September, I was having a really hard time eating.  I felt extremely depressed.  For breakfast, I poured my bowl of cereal and milk and just stared at it.  Elder Walker was usually in the shower when I was getting ready for the day, and sometimes that was all I could do—just stare at my bowl of cereal.  I knew I needed to eat though.  I picked up my spoon and voluntarily opened my mouth.  I shoved a spoonful of cereal and chewed, sometimes pushing my jaw up with my fist to chew my food.  And then I had to forcefully swallow.  I noticed that even when I did feel hungry, my stomach didn’t want food.  I started to lose more and more weight.  Every day, I would cry in the shower and even while eating breakfast.  I told myself that I just needed to fight a little longer.  Then things would hopefully be okay._

_But by the end of the last week of the transfer, I felt like I couldn’t do it anymore.  Elder Walker would sometimes try to talk to me, but I was in my own zone.  I couldn’t focus or think straight.  Why?  Why did I feel this way?  It was even more stressful that another transfer was coming up.  It took a lot of brainpower to get everything ready for transfers._

_One morning, after trying to eat another bowl of cereal and crying the entire time, my mind thought back to my medication.  Actually, I thought about taking medication several times before that.  But I really didn’t want to.  I really, really didn’t want to go back to my medication.  I didn’t want to become dependent on it.  But maybe it was the medication that was helping me._

_I reached into my bag to pull out the leftover pills I had.  It had been almost six months since I touched it.  I opened the bottle and poured one of the pills into my hand.  I couldn’t believe I was doing this.  I closed my eyes, plopped the pill into my mouth, and swallowed it.  And another feeling of defeat overcame me._

...

_On the day of transfers, Sister Beardall asked me how I was doing.  I was honest with her.  “I feel like my mental health has been declining a lot,” I answered.  “I hadn’t taken my medication for six months.”_

_“Six months?!” She sounded devastated._

_“I’ve started taking my medication again a few days ago.  It’s been really hard to eat, and I always feel like crying.  I don’t know why I feel this way.”_

_“Elder Okuda, please start taking your medication again.  That worries me a lot.  Maybe we can set you up with your counselor or your doctor again.”_

_During the first week of the new transfer, I had interviews with President Beardall.  I had also told him about my mental health declining in my weekly email to him.  He responded saying to never go off my medication at least while I was on my mission.  “I’m sorry I did that,” I said.  “I’m sorry if I worried you.”_

_“Oh no, it was your decision to get off the medication,” he said.  “I have a son who did the same thing.  He started having bad anxiety by the time he was a missionary.  After taking his medication for a few months, he felt fine, so he tried to quit.  He’s done that time and time again.  His wife told me that if he were to quit taking medication again that she might divorce him.  He was always reminded that it was the medication that helped him.”_

_I was still having such a hard time accepting that this could’ve been something I’d have to live with for the rest of my life.  “I don’t get it,” I said.  “I did fine in high school without medication.  I thought this would just be a temporary thing, having to take this medication.”_

_“Elder Okuda, everyone has different challenges.  We all have something that we go through in mortality.  Those happened to be the cards you were dealt with.  For me, I have to take medication for my hypertension.  If I don’t take it, I’d be in big trouble.  I’d even encourage many other missionaries to start taking medication.  It’s part of our mortal life to deal with these kinds of challenges, whether it be physical or mental ailments.  What matters is that we take care of ourselves.”_

_It was hard to accept.  I was really hoping that medication would just be a mission-only thing, but maybe I would have to continue medication even after the mission._

_After a couple weeks of taking medication, I felt a lot better.  President Beardall was right.  Even though I did feel better, there was still a part of me that felt a sense of defeat that this was the only way I could feel better._

...

_(October 2020) By this time, the bishop seemed to place some trust in us.  From my interactions with a lot of the members, I didn’t feel like many of them had much trust or a relationship with the missionaries.  The bishop told us that each month during ward council, each auxiliary would give three or four names of people to visit.  Initially, the people we were asked to visit were active members, but as we were able to follow up on our visits, we got names of less-active members.  Those were a lot more difficult.  Some of them were pretty rude.  Others were nice, and we were able to build some sort of relationship with them.  I was able to figure out my way around downtown Bellevue because a lot of less-active members lived in the downtown area._

_We were also able to meet Joseph and Radha again with the bishop and his wife.  This was about another three weeks after we had our first lesson with him.  I was hoping to be able to visit them again to teach them another lesson the following week, but Radha said that she’d let us know about when the barbecue would be.  After a couple weeks of this, I didn’t feel like they were solid, which was sort of disappointing._

_After we finished our office work at 5, we went straight to Joseph and Radha’s, and we were there until past 9.  It was mostly the bishop and his wife talking to Joseph and Radha, but they were again so courteous in their manners._

_By about 8, we shared a brief lesson about what general conference was and some of the lessons we had learned during the recent conference.  At the end of our brief lesson, I asked, “We were wondering if you’d be interested in learning more about the gospel.  This would include having some lessons with us about once a week and keeping commitments that we’d extend to you to help you strengthen your relationship with God.  Is this something you’d be interested in?”_

_Initially, Joseph and Radha were pretty hesitant.  I guess it was kind of a bold, straightforward question.  After a moment, the bishop added, “You may be wondering what these fine missionaries mean when they ask if you’d be interested in learning more about the message they share.”  I don’t exactly remember what he said during that conversation, but I do remember that he was able to express so much that a close friend could express than just some mere missionary strangers could._

_“I feel like if we say no that we would jeopardize our friendship with you,” Joseph said to the bishop._

_But the bishop expressed how our invitation was merely an opportunity for them to learn more about something that we found so much joy in that we wanted to share with others.  He expressed his love for Joseph and Radha and told them that their decision didn’t jeopardize their friendship in any way.  After about an hour of conversation, the bishop invited them to pray about whether or not to meet with us, and they accepted to do so._

_A few weeks later, we got a call from Joseph, and he said that he and his family had prayed and were really grateful to meet us but weren't interested in learning more since they were devout in their own faiths.  Joseph practiced Catholicism, and Radha practiced Hinduism._

_My experience with Joseph, Radha, the bishop, and his wife was a huge turning point in my mission.  It's difficult for me to describe the interaction the bishop had with this family and his continuing love for them regardless of their decision to meet with us or not, but I learned the importance of building relationships._

_I had to say, missionary work can be demanding.  Other missionaries and members expected that we were teaching people about the gospel and seeing people progress, and sometimes I felt pressure from it, especially when I felt like the people that we were teaching weren’t progressing.  But Joseph and Radha were honestly some of the kindest people I had met on my mission.  They were so good to us when we visited them.  We dropped them from our teaching pool, but it didn't drop our relationship with them.  Later in the transfer, we went to their house to drop off an invitation to the church's trunk or treat activity, and we ended up having a 45-minute conversation right inside their home.  Radha even asked us to call them about what would happen to us at transfers, which was coming up in a couple weeks.  When we called and told her that both Elder Walker and I were staying for another transfer, she said she was happy to hear that we were both staying._

_I felt very inspired to focus more on building meaningful relationships with the members ever since that barbecue.  I knew that meeting with members could be considered a waste of time since a lot of the members didn’t really do missionary work, but I saw that we needed to gain their trust, which I didn’t feel like previous office elders tried to develop.  Then maybe the members would be more willing to do things that we invited them to do.  I learned that even if people weren’t interested in learning more about the gospel, it didn’t mean that my relationship with those people had to cease.  And for the rest of my mission, that was my focus: building trust in the members._

_I definitely was able to see some of the fruits of building trust in the members.  There was a member who worked at a cafeteria, and almost every school day without fail, she called us about either picking up some food at her house or dropping it off at the office.  She brought bags and bags and BAGS of food.  It was nice at first, but then we started to get so much food that it filled the entire counter space in our kitchen.  We went to the dumpster almost every day throwing out food that we didn’t want.  It was cafeteria food, so we didn’t think anyone would’ve wanted it.  But it was nice to have free food.  I had a lot of funds accumulated on my card that I ended up buying wireless earbuds (about 70 dollars) and a TI-84 graphing calculator (about 150 dollars)._

_(November 2020) We visited a member home—the Foxes.  They lived in Medina, the same town that Bill Gates lived in.  Brother Fox was a financial advisor for some big-name company, and he sort of acted like a grumpy tech guy.  At least he looked and acted pretty rough around the edges.  Sister Fox was much friendlier though._

_Brother Fox told us about a video he was compiling together.  I learned that he did photography and film as hobbies.  Because of COVID, the ward wasn’t going to have a Christmas activity at the church building, so the bishopric asked if Brother Fox could put together some videos of the members sharing Christmas stories or playing Christmas songs.  A day was scheduled at the beginning of December when all the members would ideally watch it at the same time, I guess to make it feel more like an in-person event.  “It takes me about 100 hours to put something like this together,” he told us.  “I don’t mind it though.  I usually have a hard time sleeping at night, so I edit videos while I’m up.”  He then asked, “Are either of you musically inclined?”_

_“I play the piano,” I answered._

_“Are you any good?”_

_I never knew how to answer the question.  “Good” was such a subjective word.  I had played in competitions and around other experienced piano players for most of my time growing up that I felt pretty average.  “Sure,” I simply said.  “I played the piano for about 11 years.”_

_“Go play us something.  The grand piano is yours.  We’ll stay here in the living room so that we don’t make you feel nervous.”_

_The Fox family had a really nice grand piano that was right in view when walking through the front door.  So I went to the piano and played the "Fantaisie Impromptu" by Chopin._

_I noticed that while I was playing, Brother Fox went upstairs and brought down a bunch of camera equipment.  After I finished, he said, “You can PLAY.  You caught us at a really good time.  We had nothing to do tonight, and I thought it was just going to be another boring night.  But this is something that I think the members will enjoy listening to.  You elders are free, right?”_

_It took about half an hour for Brother Fox to set everything up.  He had set up a camera upstairs in the balcony area and a couple cameras right by the grand piano.  I was a little nervous now.  I didn’t play the piano that much, and I wasn’t expecting to be “professionally” recorded so abruptly.  Even though it wasn’t perfect, I did just one run-through of it, and Brother Fox was pretty happy._

_“Again, thank you so much for being willing to share your talents,” he said.  “I know this is something that’ll make the members so happy to listen to.”_

## Section 2

November 5, 2022.  Gyuna had called me saying that Christian was in Provo again and that they were in the basement of the Talmage building in one of the soundproof study rooms.  So I headed over there.

The two of them said they were doing homework, even though Gyuna was playing music out loud and singing along.  She tried to pinch my elbow, which I evaded.  I was trying to read a conference talk for my religion class, but I got so distracted that it took me about four hours before I finally finished reading it.

“Do you know what your four-letter personality type is?” Gyuna asked.

“I don’t know,” I answered.  “I feel like I might have taken that personality test before, but I don’t remember my results.”

“Oh my gosh, you HAVE to take it!  I really want to know what your personality type is.”

Gyuna was ENTP, and Christian was ESFP.  I didn’t know what that meant, but I knew that the “E” stood for “extrovert.”  I was surprised that my friends were extroverts, but at the same time, I felt like extroverts who liked introverts were the ones I got along with the most.

“Okay, I got my results,” I said when I finished the test.

“You’re a Defender,” Gyuna read.  “ISFJ.  That’s the complete opposite of me!”  She read some of it.

“What about romantic relationships?” Christian asked.  “Let’s go to that section.”

“Oo, yes,” Gyuna agreed.  “I want to know what it’ll be like when you’re dating your future wife.

“‘Beneath their mild, unassuming exteriors, Defenders thrum with passionate commitment and loyalty toward the people they love.  At times, Defenders themselves may be surprised by the intensity of their feelings, especially their fierce desire to protect and care for their partner.’  I can TOTALLY see that!  INTENSE feelings and FIERCE desire!  You’d definitely be loyal and protective of your partner.

“‘Although generally a proactive, can-do personality type, many Defenders struggle to take the initiative when it comes to dating.’”  Gyuna laughed.  “You better remember that, Michael!  Remember not to be afraid to ask your girl on a date.  ‘Asking someone out can be incredibly uncomfortable for Defenders, who tend to worry about not only rejection but also violating unspoken social rules.  The bad news is that Defenders can end up feeling trapped, wanting to embark on a relationship but waiting for another person to make the first move.

“‘Defenders’ pragmatic approach to life shields the incredibly strong feelings that lie within their hearts.  It’s no surprise, then, that it can take these personalities a relatively long time to recover from the heartache of a breakup—or even a particularly painful disagreement.  Defenders give so much of themselves in their relationships that they can feel deeply hurt when they believe that someone isn’t offering them enough love, commitment, and appreciation in return.

“‘Unfortunately, Defenders may find it difficult to break off a relationship, even when things just aren’t working out.  People with this personality type may hang on due to misplaced loyalty, a general fear of change, or the hope that they can somehow figure out how to change any problems for the better.

“‘In their heart of hearts, however, what Defenders want most is to ensure their partner’s happiness.  As long as they balance this desire with a healthy amount of attention to their own needs and aspirations, Defenders can enjoy exactly the sort of enduring, impassioned relationships that they’ve always dreamed about.’”

I couldn’t relate to a relationship since I had never been in one, but I could definitely relate on a friendship level.  I used to have an idealistic mindset of being able to try to get along with as many people as I could.  Sometimes people would comment something along the lines of how bored I must have been when they talked about or showed what they liked, especially if I didn’t know anything about that particular hobby.  But I genuinely tried to be intrigued and tried to empathize with how such a hobby would be interesting to that person.  Besides, wouldn’t everyone in the celestial kingdom at least try to get along with each other?

We continued to talk about our personality types, which got into a discussion about social life at BYU.  “I guess for me, it’s been really hard making friends and meaningful connections here,” I said.  “I mean, I’ve talked about my current roommates with y’all.  I don’t really know anything about their lives.  They don’t really talk to me.  I kind of gave up on them because it’s so strange and kind of hurtful to see them connect with each other but not with me.”

“Yeah, white people and white society is just bleh,” Gyuna said.  “They form their own little circles.”

“I don’t think it’s that people in general are racist or unaccepting,” Christian said.  “I think it’s more of an unconscious thing for people with commonalities to group themselves together.  I don’t think most white people consciously think, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, and I don’t like Asians.’  They just prefer to hang out with other white people because there’s some sort of connection with culture and stuff.”

“I remember my dad saying that people will talk to me if I talk to them,” I said.  “Same goes with pursuing opportunities.  I guess I understand more with opportunities like jobs and such, but I don’t really understand it with people.  Other people rarely ever initiate things with me.  And when I’m the one to initiate things, I don’t really see results as far as reciprocation and connection.”

“As a foreigner, I can kind of understand your dad’s perspective,” Gyuna said.  “When you’re in a different country and you look different from the majority, it definitely takes a lot more effort and initiative for opportunities to occur.  Same with people.  Of course, everyone needs to take the initiative at some point, but it takes a lot of effort and time for foreigners to be welcomed into the white society.  I know that a lot of white people joke that Asians only hang out with other Asians, but do white people initiate conversations with me?  Rarely.  That’s been my experience.  I usually have to be the one to initiate.  And at least in South Korea, white people are praised.  ‘White’ is a safe color.  They’re generally more financially secure, they find more opportunities, and they’re usually the model for appearance.  If I told my parents that I was dating a white person, they’d be like, ‘Oh, okay.’  They wouldn’t mind.  But my parents aren’t a fan of my relationship with Christian.  They kind of want me to break up with him.”

“I think that when we’re surrounded by people of the same culture, we tend to feel more comfortable,” Christian said.  “When I’m around other Hispanic people, I feel more comfortable.  I’m sure Gyuna feels the same way when she’s surrounded by Koreans.”

“Oh, heck yeah,” Gyuna said.  “When I was in Korea, I felt like I belonged.  Put me back there for a month, and I’ll be absolutely localized.”

“I guess I can see that especially with my mom,” I said.  “She definitely doesn’t fit in with American culture.  I remember in middle school and high school, sometimes she’d call people on the phone for stuff, and she’d always be so rude to Americans and would be like, ‘I want to talk to a Japanese person!’  And then when she’s talking to a Japanese person, she’s like, ‘A, sumimasen.’ (A polite way of greeting someone.)  I’ve also noticed that when she’s around other Japanese people who can speak Japanese, she’s a lot more vocal.  She’s definitely more comfortable around those kinds of people.”

“That’s so relatable and funny,” Gyuna said.  “But yeah, discrimination is still a thing, especially here at BYU.”

“One of my roommates is from Africa, and he was just walking down the street when he came across these three dudes,” Christian said.  “One of them called my roommate the ‘n’ word with a hard ‘r,’ and my roommate slapped him as hard as possible.  The other two guys ran off, probably to grab something to fight with, but my roommate ran fast enough to get away.  It’s hard to believe that something like that can occur on BYU-Idaho’s campus.  You’d think people would be better.”
“Yeah, well, racism still exists,” Gyuna said.

I believed that racism and discrimination still existed, but I didn’t realize the reality of it until I came to BYU.  People didn’t have to explicitly say things to discriminate; it was mostly the things that they did and especially the things that they did NOT do that made me feel discriminated against.  Even as white as Kentucky was, I didn’t feel like I was different because of the way I looked.  But it was so weird for me to come to this realization that I was Asian because I had grown up in an American society among white Americans my entire life.  I had been introduced to so many Asian people this semester from Gyuna and acquaintances from the stats department, and they seemed comfortable to talk to me.  It was definitely a different vibe from white people.  White people didn’t talk to me as much.  But were Asians comfortable talking to me just because I had the outer appearance of an Asian?  I was definitely not cultured as a Japanese person, but I also couldn’t say I was cultured as an American either.  But it must have been so much harder for Gyuna.  Her name didn’t sound American, she had an accent when she spoke English, and she introduced herself saying that she was from Korea, not somewhere from the states.  And she was definitely culturally raised as a Korean.  She didn’t just look like an Asian: she WAS an Asian.  I just didn’t understand why any of that mattered.  Why couldn’t white people and Asian people just get along and treat each other the same?

## Section 3

November 8, 2022.  About a week ago, I had been messaging a guy named <span style="color:red">Kent</span> on Tinder.
He was also a BYU student studying Spanish and wanting to become a doctor.  He also served a mission in Bolivia.  After a few days of messaging each other, I wanted to meet in person because, again, I wasn’t a fan of communicating behind a screen.  He and I planned on getting ice cream the previous weekend until he found out that his mom needed a hiking buddy at the Grand Canyon.  So ice cream didn’t end up happening.

However, he suggested that he and I could study at the library together.  I felt like that would be a safe place to get to know each other.  So he and I planned on meeting at the library today at 2.
Again, every day I felt SO vulnerable walking around campus.  What if people recognized me from dating apps?  I couldn’t help but feel nervous.

My STAT 330 class ended at 1:45, so after class was over, I knew it was time to head to the library.  I was SO.  FREAKING.  NERVOUS!  Even though I really wanted to meet these guys I was texting, for some reason, I didn’t think it would actually happen.  But it was actually going to happen.

```Kent: I’m in a weird corner of the third floor new study section, past the big group tables haha```

```Im with a friend for a second, but she’s leaving in 30 minutes```

He sent a picture of his vicinity.

**_The library_**
![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mokuda2/junioryearreflection/main/assets/images/The%20Library.jpg)

I got so nervous that while I was walking to the library, I took a detour to the Talmage building to take a nice big dump.  I just had to breathe.  What made me even more nervous was that he was going to have someone else there.  I was expecting it to be just him and me.  What if I knew her?  Shoot, I was SOOOO nervous!

I took a deep breath, stood up from the toilet, and walked over to the library.

Kent had sent me a picture of the general area he was sitting in, but I had never been to that part of the library.  I had a general idea of where he was, so I slowly walked around the area.  I still felt like white guys at BYU all looked the same, so I tried to be as casual but observant as I could to see if I could recognize Kent.  I kept walking farther and farther down the wall, and I figured that I was probably not going in the right direction.

I got to a different section, and that was when I saw him.  I recognized him from the way his hair was parted.  He looked up from his laptop, and he and I made eye contact.

My heart raced.  I couldn’t believe that I was intentionally meeting another gay guy in person.  It had been three and a half years since I last went on a “date.”

It was time.  It was time to see if I really wanted to date guys.

(End of Chapter 2…)
