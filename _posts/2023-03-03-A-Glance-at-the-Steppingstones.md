## Section 1

January 10, 2023.  It was the beginning of another semester.

I had a date set up with a guy named Dylan today.  He was the first femme-appearing guy I went on a date with.  He wore pink sweatpants and a beige scarf with a cardigan.

For our date, we went to CHOM Burger.  I felt pretty vulnerable, but I also felt like those kinds of situations were good to be in.  It definitely got me out of my comfort zone.  I was pretty sure other people knew he was gay just by looking at him, and I was the only one who was talking to him.

Dylan was studying philosophy at BYU and planned to do a PhD in poetry.  It was something I had never heard of, but it sounded interesting.  We then went to his place and watched _Inception_.  I kind of got clues that he liked me.  Anytime there was a pause in our conversation, he'd look at me kinda dreamily.  Or when we were watching the movie, he asked if he could hold my hand.

“Sure,” I said plainly.  But I didn't feel anything romantic with him.

After the movie, he and I talked.  He served a mission in Russia, tried dating three girls, and then dated guys.  I also shared my story and told him about the dates I had been on.

“Wait, I had a friend who said he thought he was going to get married to this one guy, but it didn’t end up working out,” Dylan said when I talked about Carl.

“I forgot what his name was,” I said.  “It was like… Will?”

“YES!”

The two of us looked at each other in shock.

“It’s a small world,” Dylan said.  He pulled up Instagram photos of Will.  He looked vaguely familiar from the photos Carl showed me.  “Well, Carl is a pretty cute guy, isn’t he?”

“I thought looks-wise he was, but when I met with him, he didn’t seem that great of a person in general.  I mean, I can understand that sometimes people can be very irrational when they’re going through a heartbreak, but he was just scrolling through his Tinder profile and texting other guys in front of me.  Or when I said anything, he didn’t seem to care.  So I was kind of turned off by that.”

“Really?  That kind of pisses me off.  That is pretty disrespectful.”

After some more talk, Dylan said, “This Saturday, I’ll be hosting a party, and I’ll be inviting a bunch of people, including Will.  I know you said that parties aren’t your thing, but I’ll be making a bunch of food, and you’ll get to meet new people.”

“How many people do you think will be going?” I asked.

“I think about 30.”

“30 people?!  How are you going to fit everyone?”

“Well, I’ve got some chairs that I’ll line up, and then I’ve got the couches too.  So 11 people will probably be sitting on the floor.”

“Well, I’ll try to make it!  I’m trying to make friends in the community.  I might already have something planned with someone else that day, but I’ll have to make sure and will let you know.”

“It’ll be so much fun.  I’ll be like, ‘EVERYONE!  THIS IS MICHAEL!  HE’S SINGLE!’”

“Oh no, please don’t do that to me.”

He laughed.  “I won’t.  But you know, I don't think you're just cute but more handsome.  And I don't say that to many people."

I didn’t know what to say to that.  “Thanks.”  I was sort of dying from laughter inside because it sounded like something I used to say to Gyuna.  “I don’t really feel that way though.  I guess ever since I came here to BYU, I became a lot more conscious that I’m Asian.  And I think ‘Asian’ is like seafood; it’s a very acquired taste.  It doesn’t help that the dating culture here is all about finding and interacting with people who look good.”

“Dang, I didn’t know that that was how you felt.  Well, my friends can be loud liberals, but everyone who’ll be there is pretty friendly.”

It sounded like the Church wasn’t something Dylan wanted in his life after BYU, so I felt like he might not have been great values-wise.  Plus, I didn’t feel anything romantic with him.  But it was nice of him to invite me to his party.

…

January 11, 2023.  Gyuna ended up not seeing Sam on the first day of the semester, as she wanted to get home before it would start snowing, but Sam came to the library that day anyway.  I asked him a bunch of questions about what I was reading for my CS 236 class.

"So do you think you'll keep going on dates this semester?" he asked.

"I don't know," I answered.  "Dating is so hard.  And it takes up so much time.  What about you?"

"I think so," he said hesitantly.  "I went on a date this past weekend."

"Do you have a return appointment?"

"We'll see.  He's going to LA this week."  I felt a bit uncomfortable, as Sam basically just outed himself and probably me in front of the people around him.

But today, Gyuna said she’d be able to meet Sam and me, so I told her that we were at the Wilk Terrace.  Sam and I sat across from each other, and I saw Gyuna walking behind him.  She gave a surprised expression on her face.

“Sorry I’m late,” she said.

“Well, this is Sam.  Sam, this is Gyuna,” I introduced them.

“Hi, nice to meet you,” Gyuna said.  “I’ve heard a lot about you.”

“Oh really?” Sam responded with his usual grin.

“You served in Korea, right?  I totally thought you were in one of my classes because there was a guy named Sam, but he said he hasn’t served a mission yet.”  They spoke some Korean to each other.  I was amused; I had never heard Sam speak that much Korean in one sitting.

“We should do something together,” I said.

“There’s a new karaoke place in Orem that opened up not too long ago,” Gyuna said.  “Maybe we can go over the weekend.”

“Oh yeah!  Hyeji told me about it.”  She and I sat together in STAT 340.  “I’ll have to ask her for more details, but she said it’s much better than some of the other karaoke places around here.  We could make a group chat of the three of us, and we can talk more about it.”  So I made a group chat.

“Make sure that Michael plans everything right,” Sam said to Gyuna.

Uh...  I gave him a look.  I was the one who initiated all the dates he and I went on.

After about half an hour, Sam was off to see one of his friends, so Gyuna and I said bye.  “Wow, he does grin a lot,” she said when he left.  “He didn’t talk that much.  Did he not like me?”

“I think it takes him a bit of time to feel comfortable,” I answered.  “I think after the second date, he felt more comfortable talking to me.  He considers himself ‘an introvert with social anxiety.’”  I also told her more about my concerns when he told me that he felt like his faith was non-existent.  “I don’t know why, but I still have feelings for him.”

"It’s okay if things don’t work out,” Gyuna said.  “Trust me.  You’ve been dating for only two months, so you’re still pretty new.  Honestly, I hope you still keep going on dates with different guys.  It can take time to find someone who’s good for you.”  I didn’t feel like I was “still pretty new.”  I just wanted to find someone who was right for me!  “I don't get why you're complaining about your dating life.  You literally had a date yesterday, and you've got another one tomorrow?"

It was true.  I was going on another date with Mason tomorrow.  He had texted me on the first day of the semester, and I told him that I was down to watch a movie or TV show at his place sometime.  I had a feeling that things may or may not work out with Sam as I thought, and I didn’t want to put all my eggs in one basket.  Plus, I did want to make friends in the gay community.

Mason picked me up at my complex, and we went to Cupbop right by my place.  “You’ve never been here?” he asked, surprised.

“I guess I don’t think about coming here,” I replied.

“If I lived right next to Cupbop, I’d come here a lot.”  He ordered food for both of us, after which we went to Swig.  He paid for both of us as well.

After that, we went to his apartment.  He talked about a few shows we could watch.  Again, I didn’t know what I liked when it came to movies and shows, but we ended up watching _Community_.  I actually didn’t mind it, so we ended up watching three or so episodes of the first season and then talked for a while.

“I’ve been dating guys for about two months,” I said in the middle of the conversation.  “It’s been a roller coaster, but I’d say I’ve had good experiences overall.”  I told him my story.  “Have you ever been in a relationship with someone?”

“I haven’t,” Mason answered.  “I’ve been dating guys on and off for a few years.  I don’t go on that many dates though.”

“Why not?”

“It’s hard to find guys who are respectful.”

“I get that.”

We continued to talk.  “When I was called into the bishopric, the bishopric at the time was going to get replaced pretty soon,” Mason said.  “That bishopric was supportive of me, and the whole ward was supportive of me as well.  I was scared that the new bishopric wouldn’t be supportive, and I talked to one of my friends about it.”  His friend was the elders quorum president in the ward.  “He said, ‘If the new bishopric doesn’t support you, I’ll leave with you.’”

“Like, leave the Church?” I asked.

“No, not leave the Church, just attend a different ward.  But thankfully, the current bishopric has been supportive as well.”

“That’s good.”

"It’s been interesting knowing what it was like being a member in the pews and now being a member of the bishopric on the pulpit.”  Being in a calling as a member of the bishopric and being gay did seem like complete opposites.  “I might get fired for saying this, but for someone who's going through a situation like us, I think sometimes it can be appropriate for someone to take a step back from external influences and take some time to figure things out with their sexuality, even if it means stepping back from the Church.  I put my relationship with God before I put my relationship with the Church.”

“I’ve heard a lot about how gay people in the Church feel marginalized,” I said.  “I sort of empathize with them.  BYU was my top choice primarily because I wanted to be around people who had the same standards and values as me.  There weren’t many members in Kentucky.  But I feel like the dating culture here isn’t that great.  It was when I came to BYU when I discovered that I was Asian.  I felt like because I looked different from the majority, I didn’t belong.”

“Really?  Dang, that’s terrible.  I mean, I can empathize with people in the gay community, but I didn’t know you felt like that based on your race.”

“White people hang out with white people, and Asians hang out with Asians.  That’s how it typically is.  As long as BYU’s dating culture exists, I don’t see things changing.”

The following day, Mason spontaneously asked me if I wanted to go shopping with him to get some things before his trip to San Francisco, so I decided to join.  We also went to Crumbl Cookies with his two sisters.  Afterwards, Mason and I watched some more _Community_ and talked for a couple hours.

He was a really nice guy, but I didn’t feel anything romantic.  It was weird that I didn’t feel a romantic connection, even though I thought it was logical that he and I could’ve gotten serious.  He was kind, I liked his personality, and it seemed like my values aligned more with him than with Sam’s.  As far as romance and logic, Sam was the complete opposite.  I definitely felt a romantic connection, but I didn’t think it was logical for me to get serious with him.  Even Mason and Sam seemed like completely opposite people.

I remembered Mom and Dad telling me in high school not to hang out with the same girl.  They never explicitly told me why, but looking back, maybe they told me that because they thought I could’ve developed romantic feelings and become serious.  Maybe the more that I spent time with Mason, I’d feel romantically connected with him.  And even if that didn’t happen, I felt like he would’ve been a good influence and friend.  I didn’t want to give up on him yet.

## Section 2

January 14, 2023.  I went to Dylan’s party in the evening.  He was right about attendance: there were about 30 people there.  I got to talk to some people, including Will.  He was okay when I saw him in pictures, but in person—dang—he was one good-looking guy.  Not only that, but he actually initiated the conversation with me and seemed to want to get to know me.  Super attractive!  It was too bad for me that he was now looking for girls to date, at least from what Carl had told me.

After about an hour of being at Dylan’s party, I went to pick up Sam and then Gyuna and Christian before heading to the new karaoke place.  I got to introduce Sam and Christian to each other.  Gyuna had also invited four of her friends, so there were eight of us in total.

We started things off on the right foot singing a “ddu du ddu du” duet by Gyuna and me.  Sam hadn’t listened to much K-pop, but he tried to sing along with “As If It’s Your Last” with me.

After karaoke, Gyuna, Christian, Sam, and I weren’t sure what to do next.  “Aubree is having a birthday party at my apartment, so I don’t want to disturb her,” Gyuna said.

We decided that Gyuna and Christian could still chill at her apartment.  They said that Sam and I could have our “privacy,” so I dropped off Gyuna and Christian.  I drove around for a bit before settling at one of the football parking lots.

I knew it was important to know where exactly Sam and I stood in regard to our faith, but I was nervous.  It eventually got brought up when we talked about the purpose of life.  "I think it's about living in the present that's more important," he said in the middle of our discussion.  "I think it's more comforting to not know everything that would happen after this life."

"I know you talked about wanting to find someone ambitious,” I said.  “I feel like it’s important that we know what our end goal is so that we can work our way there.  That’s why I think it’s so important to know what happens after this life.”  I was still confused why Sam found it deep to talk about the purpose of life considering that we knew about the plan of salvation.  “What do you think would happen after this life?  Would you say you believe in God?"

Sam shook his head.  "I don't believe in God.  I differentiate the 'Christian god' from the 'Mormon god' because there are some differences, but even since middle school, believing in spiritual things has been really hard for me.  I've had what people might call 'spiritual experiences' on the mission, but I think it's just how the body feels happiness.  I don't believe that there’s a spirit that gives us those kinds of feelings."

"I know you said that you want to find someone who has similar morals.  So what do you see as ‘moral’?"

"I think people create their own morals based on their own experiences, and it's all about perspective.  At least with Christianity, their god's morals change depending on what their god tells them to do.  For example, God told the Israelites to commit genocide.  Or the Mormon God commanded Nephi to kill Laban.  I don't believe that there should be a power where someone tells us what is considered 'moral.'"

"So if people have a difference in morals based on their experiences, how can people come to a consensus when conflict arises?"

"A society's morals are the average of people's morals.  Some people will be on the extremes, but most people will be in the middle.  I think communication is a big part of being able to resolve those kinds of conflicts."  When Sam was talking about finding someone with similar morals, I thought he was talking about stuff like immorality, but it seemed like he was talking more about ethics.  I had such a hard time relating to him though.  "For now, I'm still going to church and stuff, but after I graduate from BYU, I want to make a life for myself,” he continued.

"So… you plan on leaving the Church?" I asked.

"Yeah.  I'll probably just ask them to remove my records."

For the next half hour or so, he told me about how he felt like the Church cared more about protecting its name than doing what he believed to be moral or ethical, stuff like how the Church treated human trafficking incidents.  I wasn't sure how much of it was true or what it was that made him believe that it was true, but it was really sad to hear him talk about all he had said.  He also said that even if Mormonism were true, he wouldn’t want to live with the “Mormon god” because he believed that He was evil.  I didn’t understand.  How did he end up at this place?

"Dang.  You must have gone through so much to be where you are."  That was all I could say.

“I went through a lot of painful emotions, but I feel like I'm happy where I am.  Of course, I'm still trying to figure things out.  I hope you don't have to go through something as painful as I did.  But I know you want to live your faith, and I want to respect that.”

Everything that Sam was expressing made me feel really sad.  I knew that God knew Sam’s life so much better than I did, but how could God have a knowledge of the denial and hatred of divinity from His own children and still allow us to come to earth?  How could He bear to see His spirit child in the premortal existence come to earth in a family?  How could He watch that child's parents give him a name, hold that child in their arms, and see the great potential that child had?  Then for this child to grow up, experience life, and come to deny the very being who gave him life and the things he had been taught by his parents?  And then at some future day, to stand before God and to hear that child say that he didn’t want anything to do with Him, that he would rather not live with Him?  How could God still love someone who had such feelings and thoughts of denial and hatred?

"Wow... I feel really sad," I said.  "I know you say you're happy, but... I just feel sad."

"I respect that,” Sam said.  “And for me, I think having similar perspectives on morals and faith is a really big factor in going forward with a relationship."

"I'd say that's the same thing for me.  And I'm glad we could talk this out.  I can't imagine us being in a relationship and then these kinds of things being brought up.  I feel like things would clash.  But... at the same time, I still have feelings for you.  Emotionally, I have feelings, but logically, I don't know if a relationship would work."

"Well, what do you think would be best for us then?  You know, as far as our relationship?"

"I mean, do you have romantic feelings for any of the other guys you've gone on dates with?"

"Honestly, I have romantic feelings with you the most,” Sam answered.  “As I told you earlier, I usually go on just one or two dates to see if there's any potential for romance, and if I've gone on more, then... yeah.  I guess if you don't include the times that we met at the library and the Wilk, this is our fifth date."

I was so torn.  "Sam!  I'm so sorry you feel this way!"

"It's just what happens.  I'm sorry that you have these feelings for me too."

"Why?  Why does it have to be this way?!"

Well, at the end of the night, he and I still made out.  It was so weird that I still really liked him.  Why were these feelings so complicated?

"We don't need to make a decision right now about where our relationship stands," Sam said when I drove him home.  "We can give it a few days."

"Well, I don't want to just cut you out of my life," I said.

"I honestly don't want that either.  So we can just stay friends, or we could try to pursue a relationship and see how things go.  It sounds like you talk to Gyuna a lot about this stuff, so maybe you can talk to her."

But I already felt like I knew what my answer would be.  I didn't feel like a relationship would work out.  I wanted to save both of us from a heavier heartbreak.  "Okay," I simply said.  And with that, we kissed each other good night.

I drove home, still unable to comprehend that Sam and I had had that conversation.  I immediately went to bed and cried myself to sleep.
	
_(December 2020; 19 months into my mission) “I can’t believe you knew how to play the piano like that this whole time!” Zach and Nerissa exclaimed.  Elder Walker and I were in a member lesson with them.  They were a young couple, probably in their mid-20s.  We shared a short lesson and talked a bunch, which led them to ask me to play something on the piano._

_“Wow, you have the whole_ Lamb of God _sheet music?” I asked, looking at a binder of sheet music._

_“Yeah, we can share it with you if you want,” Zach answered.  “It’s such a great soundtrack.”_

_“I listened to this all the time at the beginning of my mission.”_

_“What’s your favorite piece?”_

_“I honestly don’t remember the pieces very well, but I remember there was one song where the cello represented Christ?”_

_“Oh yeah, ‘Gethsemane’!” Nerissa exclaimed.  “That’s a really beautiful piece.”  She turned to the page of the music._

_I sight-read it, and the melody did sound familiar.  It definitely didn’t compare to the cello; nothing could replace the cello.  But when I finished playing the piece, I saw Zach and Nerissa in tears._

_“It’s really sentimental for us,” Nerissa said.  “It’s been months now, but Zach and I had triplets.  It was one of the most beautiful and precious moments to be with them.  But none of them made it after I gave birth to them.  That moment of holding our precious children is something I long for again.”_

_I didn’t know what losing three children at the same time felt like, but it sounded like a difficult thing to go through._

_“Thank you for bringing the Spirit into our home,” Zach said.  After some talk, we said goodbye and drove back to our apartment for the night._

**_“Gethsemane” by Rob Gardner from_ The Lamb of God _(again, the cello represents Christ)_**

January 16, 2023.  “I just love those cheeks,” Shari said as she held Kiyoshi.  Today was MLK Day, and I didn’t have much going on, so I decided to take some time to help out Shari and David.  I couldn’t help but think about Sam when I looked at Kiyoshi—how Sam used to be just as young and innocent as my nephew.  What would Kiyoshi become when he grew up?

David and I made dinner together.  “I think your mom is a very sweet person, but I think she and I have very different opinions when it comes to making friends,” he said.

“You feel that my mom’s perspective is different when it comes to making friends?” I asked.

“Yeah, definitely.  I don’t think you have to change yourself in order to make friends.  As I told you before, I like you the way you are, and I don’t think you need to change yourself or be transactional in order to please others.  That’s something I’m working on.  I’m definitely a people-pleaser.”

“At least when I was in middle school and high school, I never saw my mom socialize with people, especially people who weren’t members of the Church.”

“It sounds like you’ve been doing just fine with people though,” David said.  “It sounds like you’ve got friends and that you hang out with them.”

After dinner, I did a grocery run to WinCo.  It sounded like Shari was planning on making spaghetti with me, so I felt bad telling her that I was going to be watching _Community_ with a “friend.”  “David loves that show,” she said.  “Thanks for helping with dinner and groceries!”  It was about 9pm when I left.

## Section 3

“Hey, how are you, Michael?” Mason greeted at the door.

“Pretty good,” I answered.  “Just came from my sister’s.”

“That’s so nice of you to help her out.  I’m sure she appreciated it.”

We watched a few more episodes of _Community_.  Mason and I had spent several days together watching TV shows and movies during the past week, but I still didn’t feel a romantic connection.  He initiated trying to invite me to get closer to him a few times and even asked if I wanted to sit under his blanket with him while we were watching a movie.  But I felt a bit uncomfortable.  It just didn’t feel natural.

A few days later, Mason texted me asking if I’d be interested in going on more dates or to keep hanging out.

```Me: Honestly, I feel like we could be friends. I love your personality, and I feel like you’d be a good influence on me, but for some reason, I haven’t really been feeling it romantically. I’m a bit confused and honestly a bit bummed. We could prolly talk about it tomorrow if you feel comfortable.```

I really was bummed.  I learned that just because I hung out with the same person didn’t mean I’d become romantically interested.  I should’ve known.  I hung out with Gyuna a lot.  I guess I didn’t hang out with her as much as I did last semester, but I definitely had no romantic interest in her.

“I just feel like I’m dating a girl,” I said to Gyuna while we hung out.

“Uh.  What?”  Maybe she found it a bit offensive, but I couldn’t think of a more relatable analogy.  My “dates” and “hangouts” with Mason felt the same way my “dates” with girls were.

“I feel like I’m just friends with him.  It’s weird because I could logically see a relationship working out.  I like his personality, and he’s super nice.  But Sam is the complete opposite.  I definitely have romantic feelings for him, but I don’t see a relationship working out.”

“I did get your text about him.  Sorry I didn’t reply more in depth.”  I had texted her the night that Sam and I had that deep conversation.

“I don’t even know how to describe that conversation to you,” I said.  “His perspectives are SO different from mine.  It was just a lot to take in.  When he and I were about to set up our third date, I felt like things might actually get more serious.  I didn’t know where he stood with his faith.  But now that I do, I feel like things would clash between us.”

“Dang, that sucks.  It probably means that at least one of you would have to change your values in order to keep the relationship going.  But maybe you guys could be make-out partners.”

What?  “I mean, that’s tempting.”  I sighed.  “I don’t think there’s anyone for me,” I said miserably.

“There IS someone!  You’ll find someone who’s better for you and who’ll be better because of you.”

“I do want to be friends with Mason and Sam though.  And I don’t say it just because.  Like, I actually genuinely want to hang out with them and stuff.  But it’s so hard to make time when I’m trying to find a long-term relationship.  But I’ll be talking to Sam about our decision with our relationship.”

A few days later, Sam and I met at the Wilk Terrace.  “Well, have you thought about where we stand?” he asked.

“Yeah, I have,” I answered.  “Do you wanna go first?”

“Sure.  I can see us being friends still, and I’m okay either way if we get into a relationship or not.”

Wow, that sounded so non-committal.  “Well, I’ve thought about it, and… I’d say no to a relationship.  It’s tempting, but I feel like with our values, things wouldn’t work out.  And I don’t want to hurt you more later down the road.”

Well, it was sort of a relief that that conversation happened, though I was still a bit heartbroken.  But I knew that it was the best decision for both of us.

Over the weekend, Sam and I decided to hang out.  We went to one of the rooms in the library and played some Dos and Phase 10.  We played for only about an hour since he said he needed to get some rest before work.  I still had feelings for him though.  I really wanted to hold his hand and at least give him a kiss.

We headed out of the library.  "Actually, the other day, Gyuna was like, ‘You and Sam could be make-out partners,’” I said.  “And I mean, I wouldn't be opposed to it."

"What, Gyuna said that?” Sam said, a bit surprised.  “I think that would make things more complicated.  And you know how I don't like it when things get complicated.”

“It's so weird that we're just ‘friends’ now.  I mean, don't you still have feelings?"

He paused.  “Well yeah.  But I'm just suppressing them.”

“I guess because I've unsuppressed them, it's harder to suppress them back.  Don't you wanna... you know... kiss or make out?”

Another pause.  “Yes and no…  We've established that we won't be in a committed relationship, so I feel like adding that would make things more complicated for both of us.  I know it must hurt.  I hope it doesn't hurt as much as your first heartbreak.  But I think this is part of dating.  You have to be willing to get hurt to make progress.  And sometimes things don't work out.”

I still didn’t understand my feelings.  Why did I still feel for him romantically when I knew that being in a serious relationship would be detrimental to both of us?  “Dang it,” I said.  “Well, keep me in check because I still have feelings for you.”

“Well, maybe I can help you find another guy.  But we’re definitely going to need to fix your Tinder.  Gyuna’s right.  It looks like a LinkedIn profile.”

And with that, we went our separate ways.  I felt heartbroken.  Again.  Why?!  Why couldn’t things work out?!

...

January 22, 2023.  I was surprised to get a message from a guy I went on a date with a couple months back.  For that date, he and I watched an episode of a TV show and then talked for about an hour.  I didn’t exactly feel the most comfortable around him, so I ghosted him.  It had been a while since I had seen him, but he told me that he had told one of his neighbors about me.  That neighbor was a BYU professor, and he wanted to report me to BYU.  My date told me that if BYU were to call that we could make up a story as long as it would be the same.

Initially, I was a bit confused.  But then I got scared.  I didn’t understand why the guy would talk about me and say my full name, especially since it had been a couple months since I last saw him.  I definitely wished I hadn’t met him.  I wasn’t ashamed for going on dates, but I could see that BYU could use its power to kick me out if they wanted to.  It didn’t make sense though.  Two guys going on a “date” could’ve appeared to be a hangout.

“That’s so messed up!” Gyuna exclaimed when I told her about the situation.

“I’m not sure if it’s real because I haven’t heard anything from BYU, but there’s a chance,” I said.  “And honestly, I didn’t feel the most comfortable on that date.”

“If you do hear from BYU, you can know who reported you, and you should report that professor to the Office of Belonging for discrimination.  I know you don’t have a problem with speaking up for yourself, but just letting you know.”

“Yeah, I’ll do that if I hear anything from BYU, but hopefully it doesn’t get to that point.”

But I wasn’t sure what the Office of Belonging would do.  It wasn’t like they were going to understand the lessons and experiences I had learned the past couple months of dating guys and how I had felt so much happier knowing what romance felt like and being able to have more compassion and empathy for others.  They weren’t going to understand, especially if the people I’d have to confront were homophobic.  Plus, they’d probably listen to the one who had more money, more education, and more experience—the one who was part of the Majority.  That was how society worked.  A single college student’s voice wasn’t enough.  It would’ve been different if BYU were like the mission where no one could date or marry.  Then everyone would’ve been on the same ground.

“I was surprised when I read that BYU doesn’t allow romantic touch and expressions between the same gender,” Gyuna said.

“Have you ever seen a gay couple hold hands on campus?  You and Christian don’t need to think twice about holding hands.  I could get in trouble for holding a guy’s hand.  That’s one of the reasons why we feel so vulnerable.”

Later in the week, Mason and I watched some more _Community_, and I told him about the incident.

“I think he’s being manipulative,” he said.

“My date?” I asked.

“Yeah.  I mean, if the professor were to report you to BYU, it would literally be hearsay.  And I know that the honor code office can be intimidating, but I know a few people who have had to go there.  They’re not as terrible as they used to be.”

“Well, I’m still scared.”

“I totally get that.  They have a really bad track record.  I feel like the honor code office would say to tone it down if you were to get serious with another guy, but that’d probably be it.  I doubt they’d keep records for every single gay BYU student.  That would be too much to manage.  I don’t know, maybe they have a record of me, but I don’t care.  And I think the office decided to tone it down as well.”  He told me about how the honor code had the word “homosexual” or any form of it taken out, but I guess there were still complications where gay couples couldn’t do something as simple as hold hands on campus.  “I don't think they changed the honor code because of an understanding of where we come from.  They did it because the news had been making a big deal about BYU.”

“Do you think BYU would ever understand where we come from?”

“Maybe.  And I could see the flip side where if BYU did allow gay couples the same privileges as straight couples that there would be a lot of news and attention about that too.”  Even if BYU did allow gay couples public displays of affection, I probably would’ve still felt vulnerable being in a community where the Majority looked down upon same-sex couples.  Maybe that was how black people felt several decades ago.  Just because the laws changed didn’t mean that people’s hearts would mechanically change.

After some talk about it, I did feel a little less scared about the situation.  Thankfully, I didn’t hear anything from BYU.  But I definitely could’ve seen things turning in the wrong direction.

...

January 24, 2023.  Tonight, I was chilling at the basement of the Talmage Building doing homework by myself when I got a message from… Connor?  I was surprised that he and I reconnected.  I told him that I was still looking for dates, but he said he still didn’t feel ready to go on dates.  He wanted to find someone to cuddle with though.

I usually said no to people who just wanted to be physical since I felt creeped out by those kinds of people, but Connor and I had texted each other back and forth the past couple months, and he seemed like a nice guy.  I really did want to get to know him in person.  And I still thought he was pretty cute too...

After some more texting, he and I planned to meet in a couple days.  I was so excited!  The guy that I had wanted to meet in person actually wanted to meet in person too!

```Me: You better not ghost me lol. At least I don’t think you’re creepy. There have been some guys I’ve met that I’ve kinda ghosted just cuz I’ve felt sketched out being around them.```

```Connor: Oh I do that all the time```

```So many creepy guys out there```

```I won’t ghost you don’t worry. The only reason this won’t happen is if homework starts to kick my butt and need to finish stuff haha```

```I am honestly tempted to ditch my homework and meet up tonight tho haha```

```But idk if I can```

Dang, I was tempted to ditch my homework too.  I really wanted to meet him!  But I just had to be patient.

```Me: Lol well I hope I’m not creepy to you. And I hope you’re not creepy to me.```

```Lolol I’ve been kinda distracted from homework too. But don’t worry, I won’t ditch you on Thursday, so you can focus on your hw```

```Connor: I just want cuddles tonight😂😂 what time do you sleep usually?```

After some texts, Connor and I decided to meet up tonight, so I headed home.  After some time, he texted me saying that he was parked across from my complex.

I was so nervous but excited!  I was finally going to meet my first match ever.

## Section 4

“Hey, I’m Michael,” I greeted as I got into Connor’s car.

“Hey, nice to meet you,” Connor greeted.

“Nice to meet you too.”  It was hard to believe that Connor was a real person.

It was a dark, cold night.  Snow was still falling, but it wasn’t as terrible as it was recently.  Connor drove us to a park while we conversed.

“I’ll actually be going to Japan in May,” he said.

“Oh, fun!” I exclaimed.  “I haven’t been to Japan since 2015.  I’m sure a lot has changed since then, especially with COVID.  You said you served your mission in Sapporo?”

“Yeah, I did.  I’ll be going with some of my family, but I am a bit scared since I’ve definitely lost a lot of my Japanese.  We’ll probably visit some shrines and stuff, but we haven’t planned everything out yet.”

“You said you’re from Alpine, right?”

“Yep, and you said you’re from Kentucky?”

“Yeah, I grew up there.  But my parents and I moved to Rexburg after I graduated high school, and now my parents are in Guam as mission president and wife.”

After some conversation, Connor arrived at the park, and he and I cuddled for a bit in the backseat.  We still talked, but I eventually got comfortable.  He still had his car on, playing some pop music.  It was definitely the kind of music I vibed with when I was in high school.

“Ii tenki desu ne (The weather is nice, isn’t it?),” Connor said.

It was still slightly snowing outside.  “Uh.  Iie (No),” I responded.  He and I laughed.  “I think it’s nice to look at, but I definitely don’t like walking in it.”

He and I talked some more.  “So how has dating been so far?” Connor asked.

“It’s been quite a roller coaster,” I answered.  “I know I texted you about my heartbreak with Kent.  It took about a couple weeks before I felt better, but I’m definitely over him now.  I thought I’d get serious with this other guy, but I didn’t feel like his values aligned with mine.  So that was tough.  What about you?”

“Dating is tough, especially at BYU.  I’d see all of these straight couples going on dates, and I’d feel kind of angry.  I was like, ‘Why can’t I feel and enjoy dating the way they do?’  I haven’t had a ton of great experiences with dating, but I can relate to heartbreak.  I feel like I’ve moved on from the guy that I was basically dating for about two months.”  I remembered him texting me on Thanksgiving about this guy he had liked.

“When did you stop talking to him?” I asked.

“It was around October when he and I kind of broke up.”

“Ohhh, makes sense.  Cuz at the end of October, that was when we matched.  You were my first match ever.”

Connor thought for a bit.  “Yeah, I guess that sounds about right.  I did get Hinge around that time.”

“I was pretty scared about downloading dating apps.  I prayed a lot about if I should try dating guys.  I didn’t get any clear yes-or-no answer, so I acted.  And looking back, I’m glad that I’ve had the experiences I’ve had with dating, even if I’ve had to experience heartbreak.”

“I like that you prayed about it.  I don’t feel like many people talk about their faith when it comes to dating other guys.”

I didn’t know why, but cuddling with Connor felt really good!  He gave me a kiss on the top of my head, and well, we made out a bit too.  But for the most part, he and I cuddled in silence.

“I’ll need to head home around 11:30,” he said.  It was about 11 when he said that.  Somehow, time didn’t feel like it existed, so by the time that he checked his watch again, it was past midnight.  “I really need to go to bed,” he then said.  “But… I really like cuddling with you…”

I laughed.  I could see the struggle in his face of going back home or continuing to cuddle.  “I can tell you’re a thinker,” I said.

“Yeah, I definitely am.  Plus, I need to catch up on homework.”

“Did you not finish what you needed to?”

“No, I’ll have to catch up.”

“Oh.  Dang, I’m sorry.  Now I feel bad that I took you away from your homework.”

“No, don’t feel bad!  This was a lot better than doing homework!”  He then held me tighter for a bit before he let go.

As Connor and I got out of the car to sit up front he asked, “Hey, could I just give you one more hug?”

“Sure!” I answered.  So in the snow-covered landscape, he gave me one last hug and then gave me a kiss.  He looked extremely happy as if I had made his day.  I was taken by surprise.

On the way back to my apartment, he held my hand, and we conversed some more.

“Well, it was nice to meet you, Connor,” I said when he dropped me off at my apartment.

“Nice to meet you too,” he said.

I was surprised he texted me later that night.

```Connor: Michael, you’re a cool guy😊```

```Glad we finally met each other😂```

```Me: Haha thanks, you seem cool too! I know school and work are super busy, but I wouldn’t mind just meeting on campus and studying together or something chill. And bruh, we definitely could’ve met earlier🤣🤣🤣 like waaaaay earlier. But it’s ok, I guess you weren’t ready for it.```

```Connor: Hahaha yeah I just wasn’t ready at the time!! But yeah I’d like to hangout soon and study or something!!```

He and I texted back and forth for a bit about where to meet on campus tomorrow, and I eventually fell asleep.  The next morning, I woke up and read a text he had sent later last night.

```Connor: Hey so I was thinking after I dropped you off... After meeting you tonight I’d love to get to know you better. Like on a more real connection level and see where things go. I’m wondering where you are at with that, is it something you would be interested in? Just want to manage expectations between us. Hope you sleep well!```

Wait.  Was he actually interested in me?

```Me: I’d love to get to know you better! Lol I actually am not the biggest fan of just getting physical, but I was pretty tempted lol. But I’m glad you want more than just physical. I guess just so we’re on the same page, what do you see as far as what you’re hoping for?```

```Connor: I guess it would be great to go on an actual date, pull back from the physical a bit, and see where things go. I’m totally open to a relationship if things feel that way!```

```Me: Wowwwwww did Connor just say the d word? So he finally admits it.```

Connor and I agreed to meet at the Tanner Building in the afternoon after his class.

```Connor: Excited to see you :)```

```Me: Lol same```

```Connor: Haha good ;)```

```I’m glad haha```

```How did you sleep?```

He and I occasionally texted each other throughout the day.  Like wow, I couldn’t believe that he was interested in me!!

…

Gyuna and I met at the Cougareat after our classes in the afternoon.

“So… do you remember Connor, my first match?” I asked.

“Yeah, the one who served in Japan?” Gyuna responded.

“Yeah.”  I told her about how he and I had reconnected last night.  “...And we ended up cuddling and making out, and—”

“Wait!  You made out with him?!”  Gyuna was shocked.  “Michael!  Oh my gosh!  You are literally such a ho!”

I laughed.  “In about half an hour, I’ll be heading over to the Tanner Building to study with him for a bit.”

Gyuna gave me that look of hers.  “Listening about your dating life is so funny sometimes.  You’ll meet a new guy and get so excited about him, and then a week later, it doesn’t work out.  But then you have like five other guys you’ve been talking to as well.  And then you find someone else.  And then it doesn’t work out.  But gosh, Michael, you’re doing so good!”

I didn’t think so.  “Most of the guys I’ve dated have only been once or twice.  And I still haven’t found anyone.”

“You’re doing SO good!  You’re actually really good at asking people out.”

“Well, I definitely prefer meeting in person.  And I guess I’ve got a first date with a different guy tonight too.”

<u>Gyuna wanted to tell me about how she was probably going to host a party at some venue that she and Christian went to.</u>  It sounded pretty overwhelming.

Once it was a bit past 3, I headed over to the Tanner Building and found Connor.  “Hey,” I greeted.

He gave a small, shy wave.  “Hey, how are you?” he greeted.

“Well, I’ve got a blog post I need to do.  We’re learning how to use Git and GitHub.  Do you know about those?”

“Oh yeah, we use those all the time.”

“What are you doing?”

“I’m just reading a few things for my global supply chain class.  I’m not sure why, but they make all the MISM students take it.  It seems pretty useless to me.”

He and I occasionally talked.  It was kind of weird because there were other students silently studying in the couch area too.  Plus, I had butterflies sitting right beside Connor.

After about half an hour, I had to go to a research meeting, so Connor followed me up to the stairs.  “Good to see you!” he said with a big smile on his face.

“You too!” I said back.

He and I texted each other more and planned an “official date” for the following day going to Panda Express and watching _Iron Man_.  I wanted to watch more movies, and that was what he recommended I watch.

Falling asleep and staying asleep were difficult.  It was so weird.  It reminded me of the nights when I was so excited about going on a date with Kent.  So far, I really liked Connor too.  He seemed like a really sweet guy, and I wanted to get to know him better.

…

January 26, 2023.  It felt like forever before Connor came by to pick me up for our date.

“So would you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert?” I asked as we conversed.  That always seemed to be my go-to question.

“I’ve taken a few personality tests, and I’m slightly a bit more introverted,” Connor answered.  “I do like spending time with people, but I also need time to myself.  What about you?”

“I’m also more of an introvert than an extrovert.  I like getting to know others, but I can be pretty quiet in group settings.  On my mission, especially if someone was with me for at least two transfers, I was pretty quiet.  But my friends are more extroverted.  One of them was asked to host a party at some venue, so she’s trying to plan for that.”

We went to the Panda Express in Orem since it was less crowded and then went to Connor's place to watch _Iron Man_.  We sat on the couch under a blanket and cuddled.  And we actually watched the entire thing.  It felt so good laying my head on his chest.  I could feel his heart racing the entire time.

And yeah, he and I ended up making out a bunch after the movie ended.  We then laid in silence for a while.

“Can you tap my watch to see what time it is?” Connor asked.

I tapped his watch.  “Oh shoot!” I whispered.  It looked like it said 12:55am.

“Oh, sometimes it goes to my stopwatch.”  He switched it to his clock.  It said it was 1:12am.

“Oh SHOOT!” I whispered even louder.  I couldn’t believe how fast time passed.

He drove me home, and with a goodnight kiss, I went back to my apartment.

…

January 28, 2023.  Christian had come down to Provo again.  One of Gyuna’s companions invited her to go to a sibling’s baby shower up in Eagle Mountain, so Gyuna, Christian, and I went up there.  I told Christian all about Connor.

“You know, I’ve learned that guys kiss differently,” I observed.  “I don’t know how to describe it.  But I’d say I like Sam’s kisses the most so far.”

“Wow, I wish I knew what it was like kissing different guys,” Gyuna said.  “Look at you!  You have more experience than I do!”

“Gyuna…”  Christian didn’t sound the happiest.

She laughed.  “Christian’s jealous.”

Connor said he was back home skiing with his family but was going to come back to Provo sometime tonight.  I wanted to see him, but I understood if he wanted to spend time with his family.  In the middle of the baby shower activities, I got a text from him:

```Connor: Would you want to go hot tubbing tonight with my friend and his boyfriend??```

```Probably around 8ish```

“Look at this,” I said to Gyuna and Christian.

“It’s gonna be a make-out party with all four of you,” Christian whispered to me.

“Uh, no.”

Hot tubbing was something I hadn’t done in a while, but it sounded fun.

```Me: Sure! Where should I meet you?```

```Connor: Yay!! Not sure yet but I’ll keep you posted :)```

```Me: Sweet ;)```

```Connor: Can’t wait!```

Later that night, he picked me up, and we headed up to Vineyard.  I was a little nervous, as I still didn’t feel like I knew Connor that well and I obviously didn’t know any of his friends, but it was pretty chill.  Being in a group of people I didn’t know made me a bit self-conscious, as I was usually pretty quiet in those kinds of settings.  But his friends seemed to want to get to know me better.

“So where are you from?” one of them asked.

“I grew up in Kentucky,” I answered.

“Oh yeah, I think Connor told us that.  What do you like to do?”

“I don’t do much these days.  But I like to exercise in my free time.  I played the piano growing up.”

“Are you in school?”

“Yeah, I’m at BYU.”

Connor’s friends asked me if I had been to certain places in Utah.  I obviously didn’t.  It made me realize how much I hadn’t experienced life.

“We’ll need to take you to Lagoon,” his friends said.  “And maybe we’ll take you down to St. George.”

“Do y’all like roller coasters?” I asked.

“Yes!  Roller coasters are so much fun!  Do you?”

“I did at Disney World for my 11th birthday.  I’ve never gone back since it was too scary for me.”

“We’ll need to warm you up and start with something chill.”

It sounded like Connor and his friends did a lot of adventurous things together.  I was excited!  Maybe I’d get to experience life being with them.

After hot tubbing, we played some games and then headed out for the night.

“So you said that you haven’t come out to your family, right?” Connor asked as we drove back to Provo.

“I haven’t,” I answered.  “I’ve only come out to my best friend and her boyfriend.  What about you?  You said you came out to your family, right?”

“Yeah, I’ve come out to my immediate family.  I’m still thinking about coming out to my extended family.  But all my friends that I usually hang out with know.  I’ve been pretty lucky by how supportive my family and friends have been.”

“What about your roommates?”

“Actually, two of my roommates are gay,” Connor answered.  “I have a friend who’s also in the IS program, and then he has a friend.  We have another roommate, but he’s straight.  The three of us asked him if he’d feel comfortable having gay roommates, and he said he was chill with it.”

“Have you had any bad experiences coming out to people?”

“I’d say I had one.  I had a good friend growing up, but he and his family are pretty conservative.  When I came out to him, he got kind of defensive, and he started treating me like an issue than a human being.  It was pretty sad because he was a good friend growing up.”

“Dang.  In some ways, I feel like I wouldn’t be as scared coming out to people I don’t know than people I do know.”

“Yeah, it can be difficult being vulnerable to those you care about because you don’t want to lose them or feel that they’re judging you.”

As we were heading to Provo, it was around midnight.  “It’s so late, but I kinda wanna cuddle with you,” Connor said.

I smiled.  “Same.”  I was sort of worried that Connor wouldn’t be as interested in me with how quiet I was around his friends.  He parked his car in a neighborhood, and we cuddled.

“So, a more serious question,” Connor said.  “Where do you stand as far as the Church?”

“I definitely don’t think faith and sexuality are a black-and-white thing,” I answered.  “The gospel has been such a great influence in my life and has shaped me for who I am now.  But I’ve definitely had lots of questions.  I know that a lot of gay members leave the Church, and I can sort of understand where they come from.  Exaltation wouldn’t really be an achievable goal for most of us, so maybe they think there isn’t a point in following the gospel.  But there’s something inside me that tells me to keep going with faith.  I know that lots of people think that faith and sexuality are complete opposites, but I think the one thing that they have in common is that people can find it hard to empathize when they don’t know what it’s like to have a spiritual experience or what it’s like to be gay.  And I hope the Church continues to build its understanding of our situation.  What about you?”

“The gospel has been a great influence in my life too,” Connor said.  “It’s not something that I can just throw away.  But on the other hand, there are some things that the Church has said and done about gay people that really make me question about the Church.  It’s a battle of feelings.”

“Have you ever tried dating girls?” I asked.

“I have.  I was in a relationship with two.  They’re super smart, super talented, and super sweet.  If I were straight, I’d probably marry one of them.  But anytime it came to physical touch, I just couldn’t.  I remember trying to kiss them and then going home panicking and crying.  But I still keep in touch with them.  They’re both married now.”

“I’ve never kissed a girl, and I never plan to.  I’ve gone on dates in high school with girls, and they all felt like hangouts.  I had no desire for physical touch.  And then in college, my interest in simply talking to girls declined.  I know that I don’t have to date girls to know that I’m not interested in them.  So… what is it that you like about going on dates with me?”

“You have a good heart,” Connor said.  “I can tell you genuinely do.  Some guys definitely aren’t like that.  You’re selfless.  You’re kind.  You’re smart.  What do you like about me?”

“I think you have a good heart too.  And you seem like a fun person to be around.  I think financial security is attractive too, going into something like information systems.  And I like your face.”

“Aw, thanks!” Connor squirmed with excitement.  “What’s important to you going into a relationship?”

“I think communication is one of the top ones, just being open and honest about things.  I also think it’s important to be patient and respectful towards others, not just to each other.  What about you?”

“I definitely agree about communication.  As long as we feel happy around each other, I feel like a relationship can continue to grow.  I still think it’s too early to be in a relationship right now though, but just things to think about.”

“Yeah, I think it’s still too early for a relationship too.”  It hadn’t even been a whole week since we met in person.  “I know I mentioned a bit about it to you, but there was a guy that I thought he and I would get serious, especially after the second date.  But as I got to know his values and his perspectives on life, that was when I felt like a relationship wouldn’t work.  It was hard at the time, but I’m glad that he and I had communicated that and decided not to be in a relationship.  I think it saved a lot of heartbreak.”

We cuddled for a while before Connor dropped me off at my apartment.  While he and I did have a conversation about relationships and our values, something felt a bit off that night.  It looked like something was on his mind.  When I was about to get out of the car, I asked him if he was okay.  But he told me that it wasn’t anything as if he were too tired to think.

His friends had invited me to go up to Vineyard again to watch a movie, but I wasn’t sure if Connor wanted me to be there.  He texted me the following day that he needed some space for a week, which was odd.  But if that was what he needed, I was going to respect it and hoped that it would be the best for both of us.

But I was a bit scared.  Things seemed to go a complete 180.

## Section 5

January 30, 2023.  “...I mean, I was a little surprised that he wanted to go on a date with me,” I said.  I told Gyuna about Connor and how he said he wanted some space.  “He said he still wasn't down to go on dates before I met him in person.  Maybe he feels like he’s going to take things too far and wants some space in order to calm down.  But I don't know!  I'm kind of scared.  He's the first person where I've felt like I have no interest in dating anyone else.  That didn't even happen with Kent or Sam."

“Dang, why are you so invested in him so quickly?” she responded.

Connor didn't text me that often, and when he did, his texts were pretty dry.  "What am I supposed to say to this?" I asked.  "He doesn't even sound like himself."

“It doesn't sound like he's interested,” Gyuna replied.  “If he's gotten dry, just be like, ‘Why are you so dry?’”

A couple days later, I was at the library studying like usual.  I hadn’t heard from him in a couple days, and if I wasn’t going to hear from him tomorrow, I was thinking about dropping off some treats at his door.  I wanted to respect his want for space, but I wanted to let him know that I still cared about him.

I wrote a letter:

```Connor,```

```Hope this finds you well.  Just wanted to send a small pick-me-up.  You're awesome!  I'm really sorry if I did anything to make you feel scared or upset last week.  I hope you can forgive me.```

```I miss your face! :)```

```-Michael```

Even though I still felt invested in Connor, I wanted to keep my word and not put all my eggs in one basket until a committed relationship was established.  I swiped through my dating apps, but I mostly swiped left.  Gyuna was right; I was so invested in Connor!

However, I had been messaging a guy named <span style="color:red">Bryce</span> for a couple days.
I texted him saying that I was at the library, and he said he was going to be at the library too.  I thought I’d meet with Hyeji tonight, as it had been a while since she and I had last hung out, but she said she wasn’t going to be able to make it.  So that was when Bryce and I first met in person.

Gyuna called me about getting her scholarship application finished, and I told her to come to the library.  "Why can't you come to the study pod in the Talmage?" she asked.

"I'm with someone right now," I answered.  I wished I knew how to say that in Japanese or Korean, but I couldn't.  "Seloun saram (A new person).”

"Ohhh.  Are you gonna make out with him?”

"Uh.  No.  We're in the library.  But you can come to the main floor.  We're around the snack zone.”

So she came by.  "This is Gyuna.  This is Bryce," I introduced them to each other.  They talked for a bit.  Bryce sat to my left while Gyuna sat to my right.  She beckoned me to lean in closer to her.

"Kawaii!  (He's cute!)” she said.

I gave her a look.  Honestly, I still had feelings for Connor.  I wasn't that crazy about Bryce.  "Shh," I said.  "Ilboneo arayo?  What if?  (I tried to say, “What if he knows Japanese?”)”

"So what do you want to do after you graduate, Bryce?" Gyuna then asked.

"I want to go into the police academy.  But I'm studying exercise science since I just need to get a degree, and I've been in school way too long."

"Oo, the police academy?  Have you ever considered being in a police calendar?  You know, modeling?"

What the heck did she just ask him?  Bryce just laughed.

"My boyfriend is up in Rexburg, and he's studying graphic design," Gyuna said.

"My uncle does stuff related to that," Bryce said.

"Really?  My boyfriend has been trying to find a job or internship to do with graphic design."

After some studying, I said I was heading home, at which point Bryce also packed up his stuff.  "I can give you a ride home," he said.

"I don't live too far away," I said.  But then I thought about wanting to get to know his background and his journey.  "Actually, I wouldn't mind if you took me home."

On the car ride back home, he told me that he had dated a guy about a year ago and that for the past year, Bryce had been working on himself.  "So what do you want from dating guys?" he asked.

"Definitely a long-term relationship is the goal,” I answered.  “What about you?"

"Yeah, I definitely want to find a long-term relationship.  Is there anything you don't want, I guess in general?"

I wasn't sure what he meant by that.  "Uh, I guess don't be creepy."  He and I laughed.  "I've met some guys who give off vibes that they just want my body."

"Yeah, they're not great.  But I'm very loyal.  We'll just have to get to know each other better.  And all I ask is honesty.  If you want to just be friends or never see each other again or be in a relationship, I'd love any of them.  Of course, I'd like some more than others.  But I don't want to waste time."

It sounded like Bryce knew what he wanted.  I liked that.

“What are your thoughts about the Church?” he then asked.

“I don’t think faith and feelings are a black-and-white thing,” I answered.  “The Church is still an important part of my life.”

“I feel the same way.  I’ve met lots of guys who talk bad about the Church, and while I do have questions, I don’t think the Church is terrible.  Have you come out to your family?”

“I actually haven’t.  Gyuna and her boyfriend are the only people I’ve come out to.  I’ve thought a lot about coming out to my family, but it hasn’t felt right yet.  Have you?”

“I have.  My family has been pretty supportive.  There are some people I wouldn't come out to like my grandma.  She’s super homophobic.  But it's okay.  I really do love her.  She's 80, so she's only got a few years.”

Bryce and I planned on a date for Friday evening, and if things didn't work out, then I'd let him know.  He seemed chill though.  But I still had feelings for Connor.

...

February 2, 2023.  I still hadn’t heard from Connor, so I planned on taking a short shopping break later in the afternoon.

After my classes, I checked my phone to see the following text:

```Connor: Hi Michael, hope you've had a good couple days. I just want you to know how I'm feeling because I don't want you sitting and wondering what is going on in my head. You are a very nice guy, and I'm glad we met and got to know each other a bit. I don't think I am interested in continuing going on dates though. I just feel like we're a little different. I don't know exactly what to say, it just feels like the best move for me, which is probably not a fun reason to hear because it's so abstract. Let's definitely keep in touch every now and then okay? I hope you can understand kinda where I'm coming from.```

It was that feeling—that sting that came from feeling heartbroken.  I didn't understand.  What happened?  Why wasn't he emotionally interested in me anymore?  It seemed like everything was going so well.  It sounded like he wanted to get to know me, and it seemed like he really liked me.

```Me: Hey Connor, thanks for letting me know. You seem like an awesome guy, so I'm a bit sad that this is what it's come down to. Do you feel like we're different values-wise? Or personality-wise? I guess I'm a bit confused what happened the past week and a half since we met.```

```Connor: I guess just more personality-wise, maybe a bit values too. It's hard for me to know what to say, because you are a great guy. Very nice, hot bod, smart, but... idk, it's just what I am feeling and I gotta go with what I'm feeling and follow my heart.```

I didn't get it.  I could tell that he really liked me.  And I really liked him, so much to the point that I thought that a serious relationship could've happened.  I asked him a bunch of questions, hoping that I could understand what happened so that I could learn from the experience.  But a lot of what he was saying didn’t make much sense.

```Connor: I can be confusing because I don't know how to describe my feelings haha. I mean, I don't think there's much of a gap in the story besides my feelings changed? What caused them to change... that's what I told you earlier I don't really know it's just what I am feeling. I hope that makes any sense haha sorry```

No.  It didn't make any sense.  It was as if a switch had turned him off.

```Me: Interesting. Well... if they happen to change again without reason, let me know ;) But I'm not too hopeful about it. If things don't work out, I think it'll stay that way.```

Connor said he didn’t mind cuddles, which confused me even more.  If he didn’t feel emotionally connected, why did he still want physical affection from me?  Well, if it would help him feel an emotional connection, that would've been awesome.

```Connor:  Will that hurt you though?```

```Just wanna make sure```

I wasn't sure what he meant by that.  He sounded like Sam.

```Me: Hm... I don't know. I guess I'll find out.```

```Connor: Haha does that mean you want to?```

```Me: Lol yeah. But it's mostly because I still feel emotionally connected that I'd want to.```

```Connor: Haha ok. Well let's plan on next week sometime?```

```Me: Sure, so far my evenings are open except next Friday and Saturday.```

Connor said that we could connect again next week and find a day to meet.

But I was still really confused.  How could someone like me physically without liking me emotionally?  I asked him a bunch of questions.  But after about half an hour, he said he didn't want to answer any more questions.

I was stung again.  He didn't want to figure out why he was feeling the way he was? At least he wanted me to think that he didn't know why he was feeling the way he was feeling.  That was the message I got from him.  It had been a while since I had felt frustrated with someone, but I did feel pretty frustrated with Connor.  I had given him some time and space, and he wasn’t going to be open about his feelings and intentions?

Not only that, but it sounded like he just wanted my body.  He didn't want anything else.  What was the point of that?  He could’ve found plenty of better-looking guys who wouldn't have wanted any emotional connection with him as much as he wanted with me.  Now I realized what he meant when he asked me if I’d get hurt being physical.  I WAS going to get hurt.  He didn't know what he wanted, he didn't have any interest in me emotionally, and he didn't know what made him abruptly lose interest in me?  Now I got really scared.  Now I understood why Sam told me no to making out.  Getting physical with someone when establishing that nothing would get more serious than that was a sign of a person who couldn’t be trusted with commitment.

```Sam: I'd say protect your heart. Don't continue to stay attached if they won't reciprocate. You deserve a real relationship where you both emotionally connect. One sided emotions make it much harder. But you do you```

Sam said he was in bed since he had work early in the morning, and Gyuna said she was at the gym.  I was in the library feeling down in the dumps.  I didn't want to do homework at all.

The next day, I went to Gyuna's place to talk more about the situation.  I had texted her about what Connor had told me about not being interested in going on dates anymore.

“Do you still have the candy?” Gyuna asked.

“No, I didn’t end up going shopping,” I answered.

“Dang it.  I would’ve told you to give it to me.”

"But Connor was so sweet.  I really liked his personality, and it seemed like our values aligned, at least a lot more than with Sam.  But Connor said he doesn't know what he wants.  He said he'd still be down to cuddle and stuff.  I mean, I still kind of want that because I feel an emotional connection with him, not merely because I think he's hot or whatever."

"Yeah, Connor sounds wishy washy," Gyuna said.  "I'd move on if I were you.  Don't do anything physical with him if he doesn't want an emotional connection with you.  Plus, I'm pretty sure that he's going to have sex."

I didn't think that would be the case.  "I don't see that with him."

"Michael, think about it.  You've cuddled, you've made out, you've held hands.  What do you think will happen after that?  Sex.  Unless you really want to be that someone who wants to have sex with him, I don't feel like it would be good for you to go after him."

"But I want him to feel emotionally connected to me.  Except I do feel like he's a bit crazy for not knowing what he wants after a year and a half of dating.  It really did sound like he wanted to get to know me and wanted to go on dates with me.  And I genuinely think he has a good heart.  When he and I started texting, he was super nice.  I envisioned that if he and I were to get serious that we would go on lots of fun adventures and do fun things together."

"I know it sucks that you don't get to do things with him that you thought you would, but it sounds like he's not interested in any of that.  I like Bryce though.  Brycie-boo would seem like a good first boyfriend."

I shrugged.  "I still don't know him that well.  So far, I think he's chill, but it's not like my heart is like, 'Oh my gosh, I want him!' or anything like that.  I guess with Connor, maybe I did sound a bit brutal over text, which is why I prefer talking about these kinds of things in person.  But it doesn't sound like he wants to talk about this kind of stuff anymore."

"Michael, don't you see that Connor is a red flag?"

"But I really like him!  He's really nice.  And I wish there was a way that he'd want to emotionally connect with me, even as friends."

"Well, a lot of nice guys are bad boys.  If all he wants is your body, then I'd stay away from him."

"I do feel like I should talk to him about this in person.  He's the kind of guy that I would ghost, but he and I had been texting for a while, and he seemed like a good person.  But I'd probably want to find a safe place to talk to him about this."

"'A 'safe place'?  See?  You feel like you're in danger if you were to be with him alone.  Michael, I know I joke around when I call you a ho, but if you become an actual ho, I will NOT be proud of you."  Probably for the first time ever, I saw a genuine look of concern on Gyuna's face.  Was this situation with Connor really that bad?  "Please!  And you have Brycie-boo!  He is SO much better."

"You met him only once.  How do you know?"

"I could tell.  He was really friendly.  He talked to me.  Plus, he's kinda cute.  He's got some build and has red cheeks.  The first relationship is SO important.  It's what sets you up for future relationships if the first one doesn't work out.  If you have a crappy boyfriend who just wants to be physical with you and take advantage of you, then in future relationships, you'll think that it's normal.  Like, Sam was okay, but Connor is NOT at all okay.  He's literally a walking red flag.  PLEASE don't cuddle and make out with him."

"Honestly, I won't, not after the way my text conversation with him ended yesterday.  I thought there'd be a glimmer of hope that an emotional connection would form, even if it was just a friendship, but I don't think that's going to be the case.  And that's what makes me feel heartbroken.  It scared me more that he doesn't even want to talk about his feelings or try to figure it out together.  I mean, is he going to get a divorce just because out of the blue he doesn't feel for the other guy anymore?  And he told me that he does want a long-term relationship, but if all he wants is to be physical, then he's just hurting himself being like that.  He says he’s a thinker, but is he a logical thinker?  No.  Not really."

We talked some more.  "You know, I feel like today is a good day to have a tea party," Gyuna said.  "You want some tea?"

She made herbal tea and got out some pineapple cakes.  "Christian has been kind of depressed lately," Gyuna said.  "He's not liking his living situation since all of his roommates party so much.  And I've been kind of depressed too.  And you seem like you're also depressed."

"Yay, we're all depressed," I said unenthusiastically.  I sighed.  "Whyyy?  Why does life suck?"

"It happens.  But you've got a date with Bryce tonight!  You better not hurt him.  And you better pay for his meal."

I was planning on doing that anyway.  "Uh okay, since when did you ever have say in our date?"

"I'm just saying.  Plus, you wanted to come here to talk to me about this stuff, right?"

Well, it was good being able to talk to her.

But I still felt really hurt.  I felt used.  It didn't seem like Connor wanted to get to know me emotionally; he just wanted to put his hands on my body.  It seemed like that was all he wanted, especially now.  Those were exactly the kinds of people I ghosted.  But I didn't want to ghost Connor.

Now I began to understand what people meant when they said that there was a difference between love and lust.  Love wasn't just about the physical part; it was the emotional part too.  Lust was just physical.  It was selfish, unkind, and hurtful.  I didn't feel like anything good would come from just cuddling and making out with Connor.  If he wanted a long-term relationship with someone, then I would be hurting him.  And I would be hurting myself too.  Why did he have to be this way?  I really liked him!

…

Later that night, Bryce picked me up at my apartment, and we went to Black Bear Diner, the same place where Sam and I went on our first date.

I learned that Bryce worked with BYU security and was a supervisor for parking.  I guess it was relevant for wanting to go into the police academy.

“There are three things that turn me off,” he said in the middle of our conversation.  “One, facial hair.  I've never found facial hair attractive.  Two, people who smoke weed.  I’ve run into lots of situations with people around the Salt Lake City area when I patrolled.  And three, people who are into pride and all the rainbow flags and stuff.”

“I served my mission in Seattle, and weed is legal in Washington,” I said.  “It’s absolutely disgusting though.  And I’m not really into all the pride stuff either.  But I do wonder what being in a pride parade is like.  I’d do it once just to say I’d been there and done that.”

 “When they were doing the pride parade last summer, we had to make sure that they didn’t get onto BYU property and cause a riot.”

We talked for a bit, getting to know each other.  He liked guns and cars—things I didn’t know much about.  He also said he wanted to be a state trooper.

“What would you say is your love language?” I asked.

“I’d say quality time and physical touch,” Bryce responded.  “What about you?”

“I like it when people are able to have a conversation with me.  So I guess talking.  I do like physical touch too.  Gyuna is really touchy, so I’m not a fan of that, but ever since I’ve started dating, I’ve realized that I like physical touch as long as the other guy isn’t creepy and I feel emotionally connected.”

After about an hour of eating and talking, Bryce and I went to his place to watch a movie.  His roommates also joined in.  Bryce told me that he told his roommates that he was gay, so they all knew.  It definitely got me out of my comfort zone being at his place, but it was pretty chill.

After the movie, Bryce dropped me off at my apartment.  “Would you want to study sometime in the afternoon at the library?” he asked.

“Sure,” I answered.  So we met at the library and studied for a couple hours.  He had to leave for work to help with traffic flow for a basketball game.

The following Monday, I invited him and Gyuna to an FHE dinner.  “Are you a fan of horror movies?” Gyuna asked Bryce on the drive up to FHE.

“No, not really,” Bryce answered.

“Oh.  Boring.”

“But I don’t mind haunted houses.”

“Yes!  Haunted houses!”

“I’m not a fan of anything scary or violent,” I said.

“We’ll have to take you to a haunted house during Halloween,” Bryce said.

“I don’t think so.”

We ate some lasagna.  It was just an FHE group dinner, so it wasn’t as big as I thought it would be.  All but one of my roommates were there.

“What would you say is something that makes you feel self-conscious?” I asked on the way back from FHE.

“White people,” Gyuna answered.  “Not you though, Bryce.”

I laughed.  “I should’ve known.  White people in Seattle were some of the rudest people I’ve met in my life.  Definitely wasn’t a fan of the people there.  I’d say my dream place to work would be Microsoft, but I don’t know if I’d want to live in the Seattle area because of the people, the weather in the winters, and how expensive it is.”

“Seattle was nice,” Gyuna said.  “White people can be rude, but Koreans can be pretty rude too.  When I’d knock on Koreans’ doors and they found out I could speak Korean, they said some really mean stuff.”

“Did you know each other from the mission?” Bryce asked.

“Yeah,” Gyuna answered.  “When I came into the mission, Michael was serving in the Korean branch there.”

“What about you, Bryce?” I asked.  “What’s something that makes you feel self-conscious?”

“Wearing clothes that are too tight,” he answered.

“Oh, really?” Gyuna exclaimed.  “I’d say that most guys like to show off their muscles.  And you’re kinda built too.”

“I’m not that kind of guy.”

“Well, that’s good.”

“As for me,” I began, “I think I feel self-conscious when I’m quiet around people.  Most of the time, I just don’t know what to say or talk about.  I’d say all of my companions would tell me that I was pretty quiet.  I feel like the first transfer is okay because I’m still trying to get to know my companion, but if I stay longer than that, I have a hard time knowing what to talk about, especially since I’m around that person 24/7.”

“I think it’s okay being quiet,” Bryce said.  “I feel like a good friend is someone who doesn’t mind if there’s conversation or not.  My best friend and I would just chill together and sometimes not talk.”

“You talk to me all the time,” Gyuna said.

“You’re different,” I answered.  “You always have something to talk about, so you’re able to keep conversations going.  And I’d say having conversation is my love language.  It’s not just that you can talk, but you know how to talk to me.  I don’t feel much love from people who just ramble or who talk to a group of people.”

“So, Bryce, how old are you?” Gyuna asked.

“I’m 20,” he answered.

“Wow, you’re so young!  When’s your birthday?”

“April 11.”

“Oh.  We’re going to need to do something big that day.  I need to put that in my calendar.  It’s actually just a few days after my boyfriend’s birthday.  Which reminds me, I still need to let him know about your uncle’s graphic design experience.”

I dropped Gyuna off at her place.  “You're honestly the best guy that I've met out of all the guys Michael has met,” she said.

"Oh, well thanks for the endorsement," Bryce said.

I turned around to Gyuna.  “Uh, you’ve only met Kent and Sam and that’s about it.”

Bryce and I studied at the library for a bit, at which point I drove him to his car at the football stadium.

“So, you can be honest with me,” I said as I parked my car beside his.  “How would you feel about going on another date?”

“I feel like so far, we're more like friends than anything romantic,” Bryce said.  “Honestly, I feel like it could go either way, but I'm pretty new to this dating thing, so I'm open to going on another date.  How about you?"

"I honestly feel the same way.  It feels more like a friendship.  I know you said that quality time is your love language.  What do you consider to be quality time?"

"Well, honestly, it's pretty hard to do that nowadays.  But I think just hanging out together is really nice.  You're more than welcome to come over to my apartment and play video games and stuff."

"What about physical touch?  I know you said that's another one of your love languages.  How do you feel about that?"

"I do like physical touch.  I don't mind cuddles, but since I'm not sure where our relationship will go, I don't want to hurt you.  What about you?"

"I do like physical touch, but I usually let the other guy initiate since I get kind of scared being like that."

“Well, I feel like both of us are going to be six feet apart all the time at this point.  I think we can continue to get to know each other better.”

“Yeah, I agree.”

Even though I didn't have strong romantic feelings with Bryce as I did with Connor, I was sort of bummed.  Bryce seemed a lot more mature, he was kind, and he knew he wanted a long-term relationship.  It seemed like things weren’t looking to be potentially serious.  I was okay with making friends, but finding a long-term relationship was my priority.  I didn’t understand why it was so difficult.

...

February 7, 2023. I didn't want to get out of bed at all.  I felt so defeated and heartbroken.  Since the beginning of the semester, I had my heart broken by four guys: Sam, Mason, Connor, and now Bryce.  It hadn’t been a whole month since the beginning of the semester, and the pain was becoming hard to endure.  I felt like I was running out of options for dating, at least while being in Provo.  Maybe I just needed to take a break from dating and try to prioritize school somehow.  But I had invested so much time into dating and socializing, and I wanted to have a better dating and social life.  I realized that I wanted to transition from going on dates with a bunch of different guys to finding something serious.  I understood now why some people focused on dating one person at a time.  Maybe I needed to put 90 percent of my eggs in one basket if I really did want a serious relationship to form.  But it also meant I'd be more vulnerable to heartbreak and discouragement like I did with Connor.

"You're doing so well," Gyuna said.  She and I were on the phone later in the evening.  "You've been meeting so many different guys."

"I've really been wanting to find something serious," I said.  "It's been cool getting to know different guys, but sometimes it just feels kinda pointless to get to know some people and then not really ever see them again.  I guess if I did feel like I could be serious with someone, I'd continue dating that person.  But it also has to be a mutual kind of thing."

"I'm sorry about Brycie-boo.  I really thought he would be a great first boyfriend.  Dang!  And I was hoping that his uncle could connect with Christian about that graphic design internship."

I laughed.  "I guess that's all you care about Bryce."

"No, Bryce is so kind.  And he really does remind me of Christian.  I told that to Christian the other day, and he kinda got jealous."

"I mean, I probably would too."

"What do you mean?  If I really liked Bryce, I'd call him my babe.  But he's like a child, and I don't date children."  I guess she was implying that I was dating a child.  "But what did you even talk about last night?"

"Well, we just kinda saw where the relationship was, and we both agreed that it felt more like a friendship.  He says his love languages are quality time and physical touch, but the only physical touch we've given was a hug when he dropped me off after my date.  He told me yesterday that he doesn't want to hurt me because he doesn't know if things are going to go further."

"WAIT!  That's what he told you?!"

"Yeah."

"So there's hope!  Michael, that's totally on you!  That's your fault!  He said he doesn't want to hurt you because he cares about your feelings and is open to getting to know you better."

I didn't really see that.  "Really?  Because with Connor, he asked me if I'd get hurt if we were to get physical."

"Ew.  Connor.  Could we not talk about him anymore?"

"I still have feelings for him.  I don't know why.  He hasn't texted me, which I guess is a good thing."

"Yeah, please don't go cuddle and make out with him."

"I won't.  <u>And I'll let him know how I feel about it if he texts me.</u>"

Gyuna and I had been talking for about an hour, at which point I got a text from Bryce that he was going to be at the library at 8 tonight and was wondering if I'd be available to meet him.  I didn’t get his text until a few minutes past 8.  I told Gyuna about it.

"Michael, go," she said.

"I do kind of want to see if an emotional connection happens if we were to cuddle," I said.  "I guess he and I haven't had many opportunities for privacy, so we haven't done that.  But that's so awkward to ask.  Should I just ask him if he wants to cuddle to see if we'll have an emotional connection?"

"I don't know if I'd say it like that, but flirt with him.  You have to learn to flirt!  If he says something funny, just touch his arm or something and laugh.  Or say something witty.  And then when it's right, just be like, 'Today's been a rough day.  Could we just, like, maybe cuddle?'  I don't know.  You do you."  She and I talked for another 15 minutes before I headed over to the library.

Bryce and I studied for a bit, and then he invited me to go to In-N-Out.  He also said that he needed to do some grocery shopping, so we went to the neighborhood Walmart.  I really wanted to ask him about trying to cuddle, but I was so nervous.  When we got into the car after shopping, he asked if I wanted to go home, but I had the courage to ask.  "So...  I have a weird request.  Do you want to try cuddling?"

“Sure,” he answered.  “I guess we can go to my apartment then.”

"I don't mean to sound like a ho, but if this is something that will help with our emotional connection, I'm open to it."

I was pretty nervous.  I was scared that things might turn out like they did with Connor.  “Well, don’t be shy,” Bryce said when we arrived at his place.  So he and I cuddled.

“Have you ever kissed a guy?” he asked after a bit.

“Yeah,” I answered.  “Why?  Do you want to kiss?”

“Only if it feels right.”

It wasn’t long after that when we made out.

“So, I’m curious,” Bryce said.  “What made you like my profile?”

“Hm…”  I had to think about that one for a bit.  “One thing that I really look at is lifestyle habits.  I saw that you put that you don’t drink or smoke or do drugs.”  Even if a guy looked physically attractive, not being smoke- and drug-free were pretty big turnoffs for me.

“What else?”

“I mean, I think you’re kinda cute.”

“Well, I hope so.  Otherwise, we wouldn’t be doing this.”  I guess that was what he wanted to hear since he didn’t ask for anything else.  “So what are your thoughts about being in a long-term relationship?”

Already talk about a long-term relationship?  “Uh, I think it’s kinda fast to make a decision about that,” I answered.  “I think I’d need some more time.”

“I've heard that wayyy too many times, and I know how that ends.”

“No, it’s not like that.”  I talked to him about Sam.  “Plus, you even said that we still should get to know each other better.  It hasn’t even been a full week since we met in person.  And I’ve never been in a relationship before, so it’s kind of a lot to think about.”

“What if we tried a relationship?”

“Like, if things don’t work out, then we can just be friends?”

“Yeah,” Bryce said.  “I can see us being friends if things don’t work out.”

I guess it sounded more relieving.  Being in a serious relationship sometimes sounded like two people were almost impossibly inseparable unless someone forcefully ripped those bands to hurt both involved.  But _trying_ to be in a relationship didn’t sound as daunting.  It was like a test run, and if it was successful such that both people in the relationship could continue it for a lifetime, then great.  Otherwise, both people involved wouldn’t get hurt as much if things didn’t work out.  “Again, I’ve never been in a relationship before,” I said.  “I feel like most people’s first relationships don’t work out.  So I guess that’s one of my fears too.  What would we do if someone asks us how we know each other?”

“We can just say we’re friends,” Bryce answered.  “No one would need to know that we’re in a serious relationship.”

“Yeah, I think that sounds good.”

“I’m also not into PDA.  Even if I were straight, I wouldn’t hold hands in public.  I think it’s disgusting.”

“I wouldn’t hold hands in public either.  That would be kinda risky.”  It felt like the same conversation I had with Sam about our expectations of the relationship and what would happen if things didn’t work out.

“What if we make a decision by Sunday?” Bryce suggested.  It was five days from today.

I was still kind of hesitant.  I felt like it was so fast to decide something like that.  “Yeah, we can talk about it then,” I said.

“And again, we can try a relationship.”

He and I still occasionally met at the library and texted during that time.  I prayed about it too.

“Wow, that’s kinda fast,” Gyuna said.

“Yeah, says the one who says he’d be a good boyfriend,” I said.

“I think he would, but it’s a big decision.”

Sam texted me how I was doing, and I told him that I might be in a serious relationship.  Gyuna was right about how up and down my dating life was.  My text conversation with Sam transitioned from how down in the dumps I was with things not working out with Connor, and then a week later, I was talking about how I might get serious with Bryce.  Sam and I met at the Wilk one evening to hang out.

“I met him in person like a week ago,” I said.  “It was definitely not love at first sight.  But he seems like a good guy, and I think if he and I try a relationship and it doesn’t work out, he said he could see us still being friends.”

“That’s good,” Sam responded.

“I wish Connor would’ve told me why he wasn’t interested in me anymore.”

“I don’t think I’d tell someone I’m not interested in why I’m not interested.  So I can understand.”

“But he seemed interested!  And then all of a sudden, he isn’t anymore.  He’s such a confusing guy.”

Actually, while I was going through Tinder and Hinge, I saw Connor’s profile.  He must have created new accounts.  Dang.  I was a bit heartbroken.  It really did seem like he lost interest in me.  I knew it was time to move on.

 I also told Sam about a hackathon that I got accepted into with Georgia Tech.  This one was hybrid, and I planned on doing it remotely since they weren’t paying for travel.

 The hackathon was focused on data science, and my teammates knew a lot more than I did about creating web applications and building time series models.  My teammates were also from London and France, so they were basically up during the time that I was asleep.  I felt pretty useless, as I didn’t know as much as they did.  The hackathon lasted the entire weekend, but the coding part was 24 hours.  I was basically a sitting duck.

 That Saturday evening, I was making dinner when I got a video call from… Cadee?  It had been quite a while since I last spoke to her.  I wondered what made her want to call me out of the blue.

## Section 6

February 11, 2023.  “Hey,” I greeted when I picked up the phone.  “Long time, no see.”

“Hey.  I know, right?” Cadee greeted back.  “It’s been a while.  For some reason, I felt like I needed to call you.  How’s life been?”

She and I hadn't talked to each other at all last semester.  So much had happened, obviously the biggest thing being dating guys.  We somehow got on the topic of dating.  She talked about some guys she really liked but weren't interested in her (a pretty common pattern with her), but this time, I could actually relate to her!  For once, I didn't feel confused by what she was talking about, and I was even able to ask her questions.  And I actually understood her answers!  Before my phone call with her, I had no intention of coming out to her, but I sort of felt impressed to do so.  I was kind of scared though.

“Have you found any cute girls, Michael?” she asked.  “Asked any of them to go on dates with you?”

“Uh.  No,” I answered.

“Any girl you’ve been interested in?”

“No.”

“Hm…”  She thought for a bit.  “Have you ever heard of the term ‘asexual’?”

“Yeah.”

“I wonder if you’re asexual, which is totally fine if you are.  You just don’t seem to have any interest in girls.  But one thing I don't really understand is gay people.  I don't know if it's because of the devil or if it's because of the world, but things are definitely different with them.  I think at this point, I'm learning to be tolerant, you know, in case my career takes me to be around those kinds of people.  I want to try to show that I love them, but I feel like I'll just be able to tolerate them."

"Do you think that people choose their sexuality?" I asked.

"I don't know.  And I guess I have a lot of questions around that.  I mean, for me, it seems simple.  I like guys, and that's how it's always been.  Anyway, sorry if I'm making you feel uncomfortable.  I definitely didn't think I'd be talking about this."

It was very odd that she brought up her feelings about gay people.  It was definitely the kind of perspective that privileged straight people had.  However, I still had a feeling that I should come out to her.  But I was so scared.  It really was the scariest telling people that I cared about or who were such a huge part of my life.

"So...  I think I know why you felt like you needed to call me," I said after some more talk. 

"What do you mean?" she asked.

“Well...”  I sighed.  My mind was frozen.  For some reason, I just couldn't say it.  “It's really difficult to say.”

"Well, don’t worry.  I have a homework assignment due tonight that I need to get finished, so I’ll just work on that while I wait.”

Ten minutes passed.

“Michael, are you going to say it, or are you going to leave me in suspense?" Cadee asked.

“No, I really want to tell you right now, but it's... really difficult for me.”

“I won't get mad.  Is that what you're afraid of?”

“I'm just not sure how you'll react."

"Well, don't worry.  It's just me.  I'll give you some time."

Another ten minutes passed.

“For some reason, my tongue is not let loose,” I said.  “Could I just text you?”

“Yes, texting me would be a great idea.”

So I typed out the text:

```Me: Ever since I was seven, I've actually liked guys. But all throughout my teenage years and on my mission and the year after my mission, I've tried to live in denial of it. I know you talked about trying to learn how to tolerate people who are gay, but I hope that you can learn to tolerate me first. You may have lots of questions, as I've had lots of questions myself, and I'm open to talking more about this so that you can understand my story.```

"Okay, I have the text typed out," I said.

"Okay.  Are you going to send it?"

"I'm scared!"

"Please send it!  Please!"

After about another 60 seconds, I slowly tapped the "Send" button.

"Did you get it?" I asked.

I could tell Cadee was reading my text.  “Michael,” she said.  “Michael, I'm not mad at you.  I really am not.  You know, I had a feeling that you were gay.”

I laughed.  "Really?  How?"

"Well, you've talked about how uninterested you are in girls, so I had a thought that maybe you liked guys."

I spent about half an hour telling my story.  “… And when you were talking earlier about the guys you were interested in, I could actually relate.  Before, I definitely wouldn’t have.”

Cadee laughed.  “Michael, I don't know why, but I'm so elated!” she exclaimed.  “I'm SO proud of you!”

“Really?”  I didn’t expect her to change her perspective so quickly.

“Yes!  I really wish I could give you a hug right now.  Like, I can't believe I have a gay best friend!"

I laughed.  "My friend Gyuna said the exact same thing to me."  I told Cadee about my recent dating life with Sam and Mason and Connor and Bryce.  "Sorry, I don't want to bore you with all the details."

"No, keep going!  I'm so happy!"

So I did.  “...I thought things were going to work out with him, but then he told me he wasn’t interested in me, and I found out that he’s back on dating apps,” I said when I talked about Connor.

“Aw, that’s really sad,” Cadee empathized.

I was kind of laughing inside because I didn’t expect her to react the way she was reacting.

"Wow, I feel like my perspective on gay people has changed,” Cadee said after I told her all about my dating life.  “I used to think that gay people were bad, but you're not a bad person.  You truly do have a good heart.”

_(January 28, 2023; college junior) “You have a good heart,” Connor said.  “I can tell you genuinely do.”_

"I don't know what happens when it comes to the plan of salvation though," Cadee continued.

"That's something that's definitely been on my mind a lot," I said.

"Well, if you feel that this is what God wants you to do, then keep going on dates with guys and see if there's any progression.  And, Michael, I mean this in the most sincere way: I love you.  You're still my little brother."

We still kept talking.  Cadee was in Tennessee, and it was past 1am over there when she and I finished talking.  But it was good.  I felt like she really was inspired to call me.  I definitely didn't expect myself to come out to her at all, but I was glad I did.

## Section 7

February 12, 2023.  Bryce and I hung out for about an hour or two.  We went for a drive around Provo since he said that a huge Super Bowl party was going on at his apartment.  He and I talked for a bit before he parked his car alongside a street by the MTC.  "So how are you feeling about a relationship?" he asked.

"I'd be down," I answered.  Bryce knew what he wanted, he seemed like an honest guy, and he wasn't the kind of guy who liked drama.  "I feel good about it.  What about you?"

"I'm down to try this too."

"Well, I guess are there any sort of expectations we have going into a relationship?"

"I don't know.  I'd say that this is my first real relationship, so I don't really have too many expectations.  As long as you're not dating other guys, I'm fine.  Otherwise, I'd probably get a bit jealous."

"Did you ever date girls?"

"Yeah, I dated a girl in high school."

"Did you like her?"

"She was really cool and was a really good friend,” Bryce answered.  “I thought that was what people meant when they said they liked someone.  I thought that my feelings for guys was something that everyone had, so it took some time before I realized that that wasn't the case.”

"Have you come out to anyone other than your family?"

"I have to some of my friends.  All of my friends would talk about dating girls and how nervous they'd get, but I never understood that.  And I never was romantically interested in dating girls.  So when I told them I was gay, it was a big aha moment to them.  They were like, 'So that's why you were never interested in going on group dates with us.'  I like guns and cars and other stuff that guys are into, so it was also a bit of a surprise to them.  But I've been thinking a lot about why I really like you.  Our interests are pretty different."

"I feel like most moms and dads have different interests.  Plus, I've never met anyone who's quite like me.  All of my companions were pretty different from me, but for the most part, I got along with them.  I actually liked having companions who were different from me because I felt like they had strengths that I didn’t.  I didn’t see them as opposites; I saw them as complements.  Even Gyuna and I are super different, but she and I are best friends.  I’d say someone’s character is more important to me than their personality or interests."

"I do like how gentle you are.  I need someone like that.  Growing up and being in security, I've seen a lot of horrendous stuff.  And it got me to the point that I didn't care about other people's feelings.  I've learned that living that kind of life is terrible—not having empathy for others.  So I've been working on that.  My main concern is that I don't want to hurt you."

"I've kind of gone through that phase of trying to minimize feelings too.  I thought it would be a better life to numb out my feelings.  But I think there's a reason why feelings exist.  It's something I learned on the mission and as I've been dating guys.  It opened up a whole realm of feelings I didn't even know existed.  I think it would be cool if we could do things that are fun together.  I haven't experienced much in life."

"I haven't done much either.  I'm a pretty boring person."

"Yeah, same.  We should make a list of things to do!  And we can check them off.  Then we can say that we've been there and done that.  I think it’d fun if Gyuna or someone like her came with us.  I feel like she's the one who can help people feel like they're having fun.  I don't think she'd mind third wheeling.  That's what I always do with her and Christian."

"I wouldn't mind Gyuna being with us.  She seems like a fun person to be around.  Also, maybe in a few weeks if we're still a thing, would you want to meet my family for Sunday dinner?"

"Sure!  I'd be interested!"

"My mom says that she wants to meet the guys that I'm dating.  She's really talkative and will ask a lot of questions.  My dad isn't the most comfortable about the whole gay thing, but he's pretty quiet anyway."

"Well, I don't mind people who talk to me.  It is my love language after all.  And I guess I'll have to get out of my comfort zone and try to get to know your dad myself."

"Even with my roommates, I don't feel the most comfortable,” Bryce said.  “They're super nice and all, but still."

"Yeah, I get it.  I wouldn't want to bring you to my apartment since I'm not close to any of my roommates."

After some talk, I wanted to make sure that we were actually "official" since it didn't seem like that was clear.  "So would you say that we're 'official'?"

"Yeah, if that's what it's called,” Bryce answered.  “We'll give it a try."

"You know, this was the moment I was waiting for—to be in a long-term relationship with someone.  I thought it would be magical or momentous, but I honestly still feel pretty normal."

"Yeah, I think the media really, really romanticizes stuff like that.  I feel pretty normal about it too."

After some more talk, it sounded like he and I were on the same page about how this relationship probably wouldn’t last forever.  Maybe it was a good thing.  After all, how many first relationships lasted?  Of course, I would feel a bit heartbroken if things didn't work out, so it wasn't like this relationship was just a pushover.  I definitely felt like Bryce would be a good first relationship though.  It was still weird to think that he was now my "boyfriend."  I felt like that title was a bit too strong.

When I got to my apartment, I texted Gyuna saying that Bryce and I were official.  She immediately called.

"Wow, so you're in a relationship," Gyuna said.  "Congratulations!  How do you feel?"

"Honestly, I thought it would be like this huge magical thing,” I answered.  “But Bryce and I talked about it, and we feel pretty normal."

"You guys are so fast."

I laughed.  "You said he'd be a good first boyfriend."

"I don't take that back.  I think he'd really be a good first boyfriend.  I guess I can't say much because I got into a relationship after ten days of meeting Christian."

"I do have two fears.  One is what would happen if I stopped having feelings for him.  And the other is what would happen if he stopped having feelings for me.  I'd say I'm more scared of the latter."

"Gosh, Michael, you've just started being in a relationship with him, and you're already thinking about these kinds of things?  You just gotta enjoy it.  And if things don't work out, you'll cross that bridge.  But make sure that he knows he's loved."

"I've thought about telling him that I still have feelings for Connor.  I didn’t even know that people could still have feelings for others when they’re in a relationship.  I didn’t tell Bryce that I specifically wanted to talk about Connor, but I did tell Bryce that I wanted to talk to him about something.  He said that I shouldn’t feel pressured to tell him, so I didn’t say anything.  What do you think?  I mean, I don't want to keep secrets."

"Hm...  I don't know if I'd say it to him like that.  If Christian were to tell me that he had feelings for another girl and that was it, I'd probably be hesitant about wanting to be in a relationship with him.  You'd need to tell Bryce that you do have feelings for another guy but that you want to focus your attention and love on him."

"I don't know why I still have feelings for Connor.  I wish I could just get over it.  Maybe I will get over it being in a relationship.  I’ve also found that dating around is like trying to find an internship.  You know, with internships, you apply and then get interviewed several times to see if you’re a good fit.  With dating, you meet someone and go on dates to see if they’re good for you.  And at least when I had an offer with AT&T, I was like, ‘What if there’s another internship out there that’s better for me?’  You know, the fear of missing out on something better.  That’s how I’ve felt when I’ve considered being in relationships.  Like, ‘What if he’s not the right guy?’  And I used to think, ‘Maybe there’s something wrong with him,’ when guys told me that they had been in several relationships, but I feel like I’m a bit looked down upon for not being in a relationship because I don’t know what it’s like.  It’s like trying to get that first internship without previous experience.  You know what I’m saying?"

"Well, I think one of the most important things is to make sure that you know that Bryce is loved.  That's what really helps keep a relationship afloat.  And I can totally see Bryce being emotionally supportive of you, just like how Christian is to me."

Making sure that Bryce knew that I loved him...  Hopefully he and I would be able to spend quality time getting to do fun activities.  It was weird thinking that a year ago, I thought that all of these "fun" activities were a waste of money and time, that even though they could help people grow closer together, what was the point if that bond was for only a short time?  Now I wanted to experience these things with someone.

Gyuna and I talked for about an hour and a half.  "Well, congratulations again."

"Thanks," I said.  "It still feels unreal."

"I'm excited to see where things go."

Today really was the day that I was waiting for: getting to the point that I'd be in a long-term relationship with someone.  Now what was my next checkpoint?  Marriage?  It was absolutely daunting to think about.  Maybe I just needed to learn how to show my love to Bryce.

I definitely didn't expect myself to be in a relationship after experiencing all the painful heartbreaks within the last month, but how else could I have expected to be in a relationship?  I still somewhat had feelings for Connor, but I knew that I’d move on eventually, just like I did with Kent and Sam.  That was what kept me going.  I was excited about experiencing another first—a first relationship.
