## Section 1

(November 16, 2023; college junior) “I matched with this one guy named Jonah,” I said as I showed Gyuna pictures of him. “He’s really cute.”

She scrolled through his profile. “Daaaaaang, Michael!” she exclaimed. “Yeah, he IS cute! There we go! You’ve finally found someone who’s not ugly. Have you messaged him?”

“I did, but he hasn’t responded yet. But you know what, God is good. He’s putting other guys in my path, even though I still feel like there’s no one else out there except Kent. But I wonder if Jonah is texting other guys…”

“Ohhh, is Michael feeling jealous?” I never understood why people acted so jealous when a boyfriend or girlfriend would “flirt” with other people, but now I began to understand. Wow. It made more sense.

I shrugged. “Dang, Kent is going to love some guy, and that guy is going to be so lucky.”

“You know, I’ve definitely seen a change in you, Michael,” Gyuna said. “The past couple of weeks, you’ve been a lot more expressive. Before that, you were SO unexpressive. You were like, ‘Define “like.”’ And I’m like, ‘Bro.’ And anytime I gave you compliments and stuff, you were just like, ‘Oh. Thanks.’” She and I laughed. It was kind of true though. I had changed a bit.

“I’m glad that you and Kent met up so soon,” she continued. “I knew that if you were going to wait a couple weeks that you’d probably not see him again.”

“I do hope to make friends in the gay community. It would be so detrimental if we weren’t there for each other. And I think Kent would be a good friend to me.”

A few hours later when I got home, I finally heard back from Jonah!

Me: HE TEXTED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Gyuna: YAAAAAAAAASSSSSS BABYYYYYYYYY

👏👏👏

🤩🤩🤩

Me: #capitalHIM

Gyuna: #godisgood

😂😂😂

😍😍😍

I'm so excited for iuuuu

Me: I hope it goes well. Frick! I can't get too excited because what if it doesn't end up working out?

Then I'll be heartbroken all over again.

My skepticism kinda turned out to be right. He didn’t text that frequently, and then he eventually just stopped. Dang. So this was what it meant to be ghosted. I didn’t like it at all, and I couldn’t believe he did that to me. After experiencing my first heartbreak with Kent, I really, really didn’t want to go through it again. Plus, I was still sort of recovering from it. But I hoped that Kent and I could be friends. I was going to take his word about him being supportive and letting him know what I was going through.

Chapter 5: A Spark of Fire (January 8, 2024 – March 13, 2024)

A snapshot of what dating life looks like for a gay man

Section 1

January 19, 2024.  I had a date with a guy named Jonah today.  He said he wanted to hear me play the piano, so we planned on going to the practice rooms in the Music Building.  As a Christmas gift, Shari created a pickup order of bread and soups from Kneaders, so I suggested to Jonah that he and I could eat and then go to the Music Building.

I picked him up at his place and then went to Shari and David’s place since they picked up the order.  I expected the date to be pretty casual since he said he had just gotten out of an 11-month relationship.

“What do you like to do?” I asked as I drove to Kneaders.

“I like watching movies,” he answered.  “I was thinking about doing film my freshman year, but I’m leaning more towards marketing and then getting an MBA.  I know Utah is great for doing outdoorsy stuff, and even though I’ve grown up in Utah, I wouldn’t say I’m an outdoorsy person.”

“I’ve wanted to know what it’s like to go skiing here, but I wouldn’t go by myself.  I’d like someone who knows how to ski.  It’s my last semester, but I haven’t even hiked the Y.”

“It’s nothing that extraordinary.”

“That’s what most people tell me.”

“But wow, it’s your last semester!” Jonah exclaimed.  “Do you know what you’re doing after you graduate?”

“I’ll be moving to Dallas and working as a data analyst for AT&T,” I answered.  “I’ll be starting work in July.  Do you think you’ll stay in Utah for the rest of your life?”

“No, I’d definitely want to go someplace else.  Maybe I’ll be willing to stay in Utah a few years after I graduate if I have to.”

When we got to Kneaders, we took out the four breads soups and tasted them all.

“Do you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert?” I asked.

“I’m more of an introvert,” Jonah answered.  “I’m not a big fan of large groups of people.  I wouldn’t go to a party by myself.  I’d have to go with at least one friend.  When it comes to networking events, those are definitely not for me.  What about you?”

“I’m more of an introvert too.  I have a short social battery lifespan, but I do like getting to know people.  My love language is when people talk to me.”

“I like getting to know people too.  I think the mission really helped me get out of my comfort zone.  Last summer, I was the only one in the house since all of my roommates were gone, and it was super lonely.  I definitely don’t want that to happen.”

He and I ranked our favorite bread and soups, and then we went to the Music Building afterwards.

“I mostly played classical music growing up,” I said when he and I sat down in one of the practice rooms.  “I really like Chopin.  Do you know any classical piano songs?”

“Not really,” Jonah answered.  “I know ‘Clair de Lune.’  It’s super pretty.”

“I like that piece too.  I can play most of it from memory.”  I played it for him.  It was odd but cool that I was playing the piano for someone on a first date.  I hadn’t done anything quite like this.

After the last chord, Jonah took a deep breath.  “Can we just let the air sink in for a moment?” he said after I finished.  “You’re really good at the piano.”

He and I talked for a couple hours about our families, our hobbies, and our work.

“I don’t have many hobbies,” I said.  “I’m pretty open to trying new things, but I still have yet to find something that I’d be passionate about.  It’ll be weird coming home from AT&T and having the whole evening to myself.  I played video games growing up but not anymore.  Maybe I’ll get back into that.  But I want to find other stuff too.”

“What did you play?” Jonah asked.

“Mostly Nintendo.  I’ve been thinking about getting a Switch when I go to Dallas.  My dad gave me his Switch, but I left it in Rexburg since I didn’t want it to be a distraction.”

“You could stream.  You have a nice face for it.”  Jonah playfully slapped my thigh.

“I know you said you liked watching movies.  What else do you like?”

“I did a lot of film and video editing on my mission, so I enjoyed that.”

“I’ve thought a lot about learning how to do photography as a hobby.  Did you use any fancy cameras?”

“Yeah, we had a lot of different equipment.  I learned a lot about it from my mission.”

“I think it’d be cool to learn from someone who knows.”

“Sounds like we need a second date.”  I felt Jonah’s knee touch mine.

“Yeah, I’m down,” I answered.  “Do you have a fancy camera?”

“I don’t, but the library has some.”  He then asked, “As far as dating, what are you looking for in the long run?”

“I want to be in a long-term relationship.  My ex and I were in a relationship for only a couple months, but it was a good experience.  I learned that I want something long-term, though more recently, I’ve been focusing more on trying to find friends.  I’m a pretty skeptical person in general.  I feel like it’s difficult to know someone enough to want to be in a relationship after only two or three dates, so I like to take my time.  When I first started dating, it was nice getting to know people, but I usually met people only once.  Even if we left on good terms, we’d just follow each other on social media and that’d be it.  I want to find people who’ll still want to be friends, even if a relationship doesn’t work out.  What about you?”

“I see myself getting married to a man and settling down and having a family.  I tried dating a girl, and that didn’t go well.  I felt really bad because I was basically using her as an experiment.  I ghosted her after some time, and looking in retrospect, I see that I did the same thing that my ex did to me.  Oops.  But after a couple weeks, we saw each other, and we talked about it.  She and I are on good terms now.  But I definitely don’t want to live life by myself.”

“Me neither.  It’s sad that we have to keep things hidden and secret when it comes our dating lives.”

We talked some more.

“What are your thoughts about the Church?” Jonah asked.

“I still value the gospel,” I answered.  “It’s been a huge influence in my life growing up.  I don’t think it’s a black-and-white thing where I can choose either the gospel or my sexual orientation and leave the other behind.  I think the gospel is something that should be for everyone.  I’ve found a group of friends at an institute class for LGBTQ members and allies, and it opened my eyes to see that there are others who value both.  I still have lots of questions, and there have been times when people in the Church have said or done things that are wrong and hurtful to the LGBTQ community.  But the principles of the gospel and my relationship with God are what matter to me most.  What about your thoughts on the Church?”

“I feel the same way.  It’s important to me, and my mission changed me, but I also have questions like you.”  He told me about his ex.  “I had just gotten off the mission and jumped into dating.  Things seemed to line up well with him.  He also goes to BYU, and he grew up in a town close to where I live, so I thought that things would work out.  Last summer, he went abroad, and communication was pretty difficult.  He texted me maybe like once a day, and sometimes he wouldn’t text me at all.  So after some time, I decided to call it off, and we broke up.  It was pretty difficult for me since he was mostly my social life, but lately, I’ve been able to make friends at my work.”

“That’s tough.  Have you told your family about your relationship?”

“I came out to my mom, and she handled it well, though I never mentioned about my relationship to my parents.  I think I’m most worried about my mom being concerned.  I know it’s my life, and I can make my own decisions, but it’s still hard to let down family.  Have you come out to your family?”

“I have.  The way I came out was writing a blog about the past school year.  I got pretty different reactions from my family.  I feel like my sister and sister-in-law are most supportive.  I also feel that my brother-in-law is supportive as well.  My brother told me he’s not supportive of my decision to date guys, but I think he’s more on the fence about things and just needs some time to understand.  I think my parents have the most difficult time with it, especially my dad.  Growing up, I had a hard time trusting my parents with life concerns.  They helped me with my physical and financial needs, but I definitely feel a gap in the emotional aspect.  I think part of the reason why I had a hard time opening up to them was because I was scared what they’d think if they found out I was gay, and I grew up trying to live in self-denial, thinking that if I didn’t acknowledge these feelings that they’d go away somehow.  Now that I know their reaction and was sort of right about how things would turn out, it’s been really difficult for me to want any sort of emotional connection with them.”

“Dang, I’m sorry.  I struggled a lot with internalized homophobia too.  It’s not easy.”

There was a slight pause.  “So… when are we going on our second date?” I asked.

Jonah giggled flirtatiously and rubbed his knee against mine again.  “What does your schedule look like next week?”

“I could do next Monday, Thursday, or Friday evening.”

“How about Monday?”

“Sure.”  I blocked Monday evening in my calendar.

“I’ll make sure to check out a camera at the library.  I’m trying to think of a place where there are good things to take pictures of.”

“The LSB has those life-size animals,” I suggested.

“That’s actually a great idea!  Let’s go there.”

We then walked back to my car.  “It’s so cold,” Jonah said as he shivered.  He bumped his arm against mine, which I thought was an accident.  He did it again, and I sorta liked it, so I did it back.  We stood close to each other for warmth.

I drove him back to his home.  “Thank you for Kneaders and playing the piano for me,” he said.

“Of course!” I responded.  “Thank you for spending time with me.”

“Is it okay if I give you a hug?”

“Sure.”

He embraced me with both arms.  I felt his scruff against my cheek during those few seconds.  “Thank you for tonight,” he said.  “Can’t wait for Monday.”  I felt him take my hand in his for just a subtle second as he got out of the car.

I couldn’t lie; he was a super cute guy.  I didn’t expect a second date, but I was excited—so excited that I couldn’t stop thinking about him over the weekend.  I couldn’t wait for Monday either.

Section 2

January 22, 2024.

Jonah: I have the camera ready and everything:) Does 6:00 still work?

I’m excited to see your smile again

Me: Yeah, 6 still works! Haha aw, kinda makes me blush. I’m excited to see your face in general.

It was finally Monday!  For some reason, I got super nervous when I went to the LSB.  I tried to calm my nerves as I waited on the couch.  Finally, I saw him walking out of the elevator.

“Hey!” I greeted.

“Hey.”  He and I gave each other a hug.  “I got the camera here.”  It was a small Canon camera.  He and I sat on the couch as he put the camera together.  He tried it out.  “Hm, it’s not working well.”  He took apart the lens.  “Looks like there are some crumbs in here.”

“Oh.  Yum.”

“The cameras in the library are not the most well-maintained.  I feel like someone could get away with checking in a camera with a scratch.”

Jonah taught me about the exposure triangle, and we took some pictures of plants.  The LSB is mostly lit by the sun, so 6pm was a bit late since it was completely dark by that time.  But we took some pictures of the animals they had exhibited throughout the building.

“Look at you!  You’re a pro!” Jonah complimented me as he patted my shoulder.

“Do you take lots of pictures of yourself?” I asked.

“Not really.  I feel dumb when I smile in front of a camera.”  I noticed that anytime he’d smile or laugh, he’d cover his mouth.  I didn’t think he looked dumb.

He and I also went to the Eyring Science Center and took some more photos there.

“I don’t know this building too well,” I said.  “I’d come here occasionally to look at my physical science exams.”  He and I looked at the rocks.  “Do you like rocks?”

“They’re cool,” Jonah answered.  “Do you?”

I shrugged.  “Not really,” I replied.

He shrugged too.  “Yeah, same.”

I laughed inside.  I could tell he liked me.  I learned that he took physical science last semester in the same building on the same floor as I took one of my stat classes.  I was pretty sure I occasionally walked past him on my way to class since he looked so familiar.

He and I wandered around for a bit.  “Have you eaten dinner yet?” Jonah asked.

“Yeah, I ate a bit,” I answered.  “Have you?”

“I haven’t.  Are you down to eat somewhere?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty open for the rest of the night.”

“Okay good, I don’t want to keep you from something.”

He and I walked to the outskirts of campus to his car.  “I normally don’t have a car, but the Sundance Film Festival is happening up in Salt Lake.  My parents allowed me to borrow the car for the week.”

“That’s super nice of them,” I said.  “I didn’t have a car until my parents left for Guam, and then they gave me the minivan.  It’s been super nice to be able to go places on my own.”

“I’ve got classes up at the Salt Lake Center, and I usually take the bus and the train to get there.  Having a car is super nice.”

At Wendy’s, Jonah ordered for himself and for me.  “How would you describe your friends?” I asked when we sat down.

He talked about some of his friends and what they were like.  “I usually hang out one-on-one,” he continued.  “I don’t really have a big group of friends.”

The way he described his friends and how he typically hung out one-on-one sounded so similar to my experiences.  Even within the first couple of dates, I was surprised by how similar our personalities and experiences were, even if our interests differed.

After we finished eating, we got back in the car.  “Thanks for the meal,” I said as I put my hand on his arm.

“Yeah, of course!” he responded with excitement.  I could tell he wanted to touch my arm back.  “Well… what do you wanna do now?”

I wanted to spend more time with him, but I didn’t know what to do.  I shrugged.  “Um…  I don’t know.”

“I need to fill the car with gas, so I’ll go to Costco.”

So that was what we did.

“Would you say you like structure or spontaneity more?” I asked.

“I like having a plan and knowing what I’m going into, but I don’t mind spontaneity sometimes,” Jonah answered.  “Maybe like 30 percent spontaneity.  What about you?”

“I’m the same way.  My friend I came out to first is super spontaneous.  She’ll ask if I’m ready to do something in five minutes, but I already have something going on.  But she knows how to have fun and knows how to help others have fun.  I need those kinds of friends.”

For at least half an hour, Jonah drove around Provo, and we talked.  I guess this was his 30 percent spontaneity kicking in, and I sure didn’t mind it.  “Would you be down for a third date?” Jonah asked.

“Sure,” I responded.  “What would you want to do?”

“We’ll think of something as long as you’re down for a third date.”

“Yeah, of course!”

“Okay good.”  He smiled.  “That’s really good.”

I told him about how I wanted to be more cultured with movies, and he asked me what movies I had recently watched.

“On the way to and from Connecticut, I watched La La Land,” I said.  “It was okay.  There’s one song that I liked, and I could see how the acting was good, but the plot wasn’t the most enjoyable for me.”

“Have you watched Barbie or Oppenheimer?” Jonah asked.

“Yeah, I watched both last summer when I was in Dallas.”

“Which do you like better?”

“Definitely Barbie.  Oppenheimer was too political for me to understand and enjoy.”

“I watched both of them like four times each since I watched them with different people.  They’re both good in their own ways.  What else have you watched?”

“I also watched the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie on my flight.”

“What did you think of it?”

“It was okay.  Maybe not the kind of movie I’d absolutely want to watch.  But I thought the one police guy was hot.”

“What about the plot or the acting or the scenery?”  I could tell Jonah was trying to change the subject.

“They were okay.”

After some more discussion, he said he felt like he was getting an idea of what I liked.  He parked his car in the Chick-fil-A parking lot and made a list of five movies.  We decided that the first movie we’d watch was Your Name.

We talked some more.  “Is it okay if I hold your hand?” Jonah asked out of the blue.

My heart skipped a beat.  I noticed he’d sometimes look down at my hand.  “Yeah,” I answered.

So he and I held hands.  “Are you sure?” he asked.  “I know you said you’d want to see if we’d be friends first, so I just want to make sure that this is okay.”

“Yeah, this is great.”  It really was.  Why would I want to say no to him?

The parking lot was filled with cars, so I was a bit nervous for a moment, but our hands were pretty hidden from view.  Holding his hand felt so amazing.  We stared into each other’s eyes.  Part of me really wanted to kiss him, but I was a bit scared by how many cars and people there were.  Plus, I liked him enough that I wanted to save that kiss for some time later.  I didn’t want things to happen too quickly.

Jonah had turned the engine off, but he left the battery running.  After some time, the battery ran out, so he couldn’t turn the engine back on.  He lived only about a block away, so his roommate came by and tried to jumpstart the car.  However, the car engine didn’t want to start.  After about an hour of not being able to get the engine to work, Jonah’s roommate ended up dropping me off at my place.

“Thanks for tonight,” Jonah said as he gave me a hug.  “Sorry about the car situation.”

“No worries, I’m glad we got to spend time together,” I said.  “Let me know when you’re able to get your car running.”

“For sure.  And I’ll text you about when we’ll meet next time.”

He later suggested that he could see me at the end of the week during his office hours at work.  During that time, I found a place in the Wilk and waited for him to show up.  I didn’t hear anything from him though.  I had to run a last-minute errand for the data science club, so I had to leave early anyway.  I let him know about it.  He texted me later that night saying that things had gotten busy and that he was sorry for not texting me earlier.

Instead, he and I met a few days later to watch a film at the Sundance Film Festival in Salt Lake City.  He had a friend with him too.  The three of us watched the film, and I dropped them off.

After dropping off Jonah’s friend, Jonah and I talked about watching Your Name in a few days.  We gave each other a hug.

“It feels so good,” I mumbled as I hugged him.  I felt a lot more comfortable giving him hugs than when I first met him.  He squeezed me in his arms for a second and then gave me a kiss on the cheek before he headed out.

January 29, 2024.

Jonah: Heyy how are you doing?

Also what’s your last name? Ahha I like to have full names for my contacts

Me: Just about to go to the gym! And my last name is Okuda! What’s yours again?

He texted me his last name.

Me: Aw cute! I’m gonna go stalk you now lol

I screenshot one of his older profile pictures and sent it to him.

Me: Omg look at you, you’re so handsome when you smile at the camera!

Jonah: Please stalk to your heart’s content!

Hahahaha idk I still feel dumb when I smile like that lol

Me: Awww, that mindset’s gotta change! Like I’m not saying it just cuz, like, I’m being serious! You’re so cute! We’ll work on it together.

Jonah: Ah haha you’re so sweet for saying that though!! Yes let’s work on it:)

Jonah and I made plans to meet later tonight to do homework together.  I met him at one of the buildings on campus.  For the most part, we did our own thing.  He said he was able to get a lot done.  It was definitely not like trying to do homework with Gyuna.

“I can give you a ride back to your place,” I said as Jonah and I walked outside.

“Aw thanks!  That would be great,” he said.  “It’s super cold outside.”

I drove him to his place.  “You said you played Nintendo mostly growing up?  Which ones did you play?” he asked.

“Mostly Nintendo, stuff like Zelda and Pokémon,” I answered.  “Fire Emblem is the one I play the most.  There’s one Fire Emblem game on the Wii, and it gives a count of the number of times I beat the game.  I think I’ve hit over 60.  It’s a bit embarrassing.  Too many hours on that game.”

“Wow, green flag!”  He and I laughed.

When I dropped him off, we gave each other a hug.  I really wanted to kiss him, and I could tell he wanted to kiss me.  We leaned our foreheads against each other, and I stared into his eyes.  And then we kissed.  And we kissed again.  And again.  And again.  And again.

It was an understatement to say that making out with Jonah was nice.  Mm!

“You’re really cute,” I said.  “Like, you’re really, really cute.”

He giggled as he blushed.  “No, you,” he said.  “You're cute in your pictures, but in person, you're really handsome.  And just from the first time we met, I could tell from your vibes that you're really nice, which is something I want in someone.”

“I'm surprised by how much we have in common with our personalities and the way we interact with people.”

After some time, he got out of the car.  I couldn’t wait for Wednesday, which was when we planned on watching Your Name.

Wednesday rolled around, and I asked if he was still available to watch the movie.  Initially, he said yes, but then he realized he had a meeting during that time.  He asked if we could reschedule for another day.  I suggested Friday, to which he responded on that day that he had something for work that weekend.

One thing that I did find a bit odd was feeling like there was a lack of communication when we weren’t in person.  He texted maybe once or twice a day, sometimes not even for a whole day.  I understood that things could get busy, but when he said he was busy, he didn’t suggest an alternative.  I asked what his Sunday or Monday evening looked like, but he didn’t respond.

I was ghosted.  I guess the feeling of a lack of communication was a warning sign, but now I felt like this situation was a red flag.  I was bummed.  I liked spending time with him, though in the back of my mind, I was still skeptical if things would actually go further considering that he had gotten out of a relationship not too long ago.  Maybe he just wanted to make out with me and then end things.  I hated getting my feelings played like that.  Piece of horny trash.

Section 2

February 11, 2024.  Going to Seattle and Korea over the summer was on my mind for quite a bit.  I looked at the ticket prices every day to see if they’d get any lower.  I wanted to see if I could go to Korea with Gyuna, but she wasn’t sure when she’d be going since she didn’t know when her internship would begin.  At this point, I knew it was about time to buy tickets if I wanted to go somewhere late April or early May.  I decided to hold off on going to Korea since I didn’t have much experience with traveling, especially going to a foreign country by myself.

Tao had served his mission in Tacoma, so I thought it would be fun to go to Seattle together.  Things didn’t work out, so I’d end up going to Seattle by myself if I wanted to go.  At least I knew people in the area.  I was still scared about buying plane tickets though, I guess because I was afraid of spending so much money and then regretting it.  I asked Shari if she could help me out, so I went to her place.  She gave me some recommendations.

I also told her about Jonah.  She warned me to be careful and to take things slow.  My skepticism supported the idea since he was pretty bad at being responsive.  He definitely lost some points after dropping off like that.

Shari and David talked to me about their experiences with dating.  “Just know that you’re still pretty young,” she said.  I found it a bit ironic she said that considering that she and David both got married at a younger age.

“Considering how very limited people’s views are here, it affects others who are also in a similar situation,” David said.  “I think people outside of BYU have had space to mature.  Plus, Dallas is a big city.  I’m sure there are plenty of opportunities to date there.”

“I think Nozomu needed to get out of BYU and experience the world outside of BYU’s culture,” Shari said.  “He stayed there all the way to his master’s, and when he moved to New York for his PhD, I think that was when things changed.  I didn’t think he’d ever get married.”  I didn’t think he’d ever get married either.  He was less socially intelligent during his time at BYU, at least from what I remembered when he interacted with people there, and he was an Asian man too.  “But then he reconnected with Deanna years after they met, and it was a surprise for all of us.  Who knows, that might happen to you too.”

“Know that you may be in a spot where you don't receive support,” David said.  “It sounds like you've received a lot of support and have good friends who value the gospel.  But know that that may not always be the case.  Not to say that it's going to happen.  But we want to support you in the gospel if that's what you desire and makes you happy.  We also want to support you if you don’t feel support from your ward and you decide to leave.”

"People say to love and accept others," Shari said, "but in reality, do they?  If you and your future husband were to attend church, would you receive callings?  Would you have a chance to become a bishop?  Would you be able to get sealed in the temple?  I remember during my first Sunday in this ward, a father bore his testimony about how his daughter was gay and how he saw her for who she was and how much he began to understand more about her.  The following Sunday, the bishop said that talking about anything LGBTQ was unacceptable.  After church, we had a linger longer, and there were whispers everywhere.  'I can't believe he said that!'  'Why would he talk about that?'  But for me, I thought it was profound how much he had changed with his understanding.  And that's the kind of member I want to be—someone who is understanding of other people's circumstances."

After some time, I bought plane tickets!  David also gave me his Nikon camera, so maybe I’d bring it with me to Seattle.  I reached out to several members in the different areas I served, and they said they were excited to see me, which made me excited too.  Planning for a trip like this was a bit daunting, but now it was something I was looking forward to.

…

School and social life kept me pretty busy as usual.  My institute friends and I still hung out about once a week, and we sometimes did other activities like a Valentine’s Day-themed party.

I was part of the statistics club leadership and had hosted an academic tournament for an activity.  I was also part of the data science club leadership, and we were planning and executing activities, including a data science networking event.

I did research for the math department as my part-time job, and it was that time of the year where I had to prepare a presentation on my research to some of the faculty, so that kept me busy.

For church, I was occupied accompanying the choir for stake conference, which happened recently as well.

I was invited to a cybersecurity competition with Deloitte, which was going to be a three-day event happening in Texas the following weekend.

At the end of last semester, Tao had invited me to be part of a council for the Office of Belonging that involved creating resources for LGBTQ students in terms of spiritual content.  The council initially met every other week, but then it changed to once a week.  A lot of the things talked about were outlines and theories as far as what a good foundation looked like in terms of resources before coming up with exercises and activities.  Everyone in the council had great insights, and it was an honor getting to listen to my peers’ stories and perspectives.

It was also midterm season, so the workload was starting to pick up.  I still managed to make time to go on dates with other guys too.  I know I haven’t talked much about the academic and social aspects of my life, so the above is a snapshot of what it’s been like this school year.

Section 3
February 18, 2024.  “Oh, he’s a cutie,” Gyuna said.  I showed a picture of Jonah to her.  “I’m invested.”

“He and I first matched around the time that I started dating guys,” I said.  “I learned that he had gotten into a relationship, so that was probably why he ghosted me.  When I came back from Connecticut, I saw his profile, and he looked familiar.  He’s cute and has a pretty similar personality to mine, but he’s kinda flaky with communication, especially when we’re not in person.”

“Have you made out with him yet?”

“… Yeah.”

“Michael!  You ho!  But hey, at least you made out with him.”

That wasn’t my objective.

About a week after I last texted Jonah, he texted me out of the blue saying that he had a pretty stressful week at work and that he was sorry for pushing me out.  I texted him back that I understood that life gets busy and to let me know instead of leaving me hanging.

He and I planned on watching Your Name today.   I was definitely more on guard with my feelings though.  I felt like this was a first date all over again.  I picked him up at his place and headed to campus.

“Long time, no see,” I said as he hopped into the car.

“Yeah, sorry,” he responded.  “Things got super busy with filming stuff.  We had to remake things over and over again.”

“Is it all good now?”

“Yeah.  Thankfully, it’s calmed down.  How was the cybersecurity competition?”

“It was good.”  I had flown back yesterday.  “I got pretty spoiled eating all-you-can-eat free food.”

We found a classroom in one of the buildings, and Jonah set up his laptop to watch the movie.  As we were watching the movie, I noticed that Jonah was rearranging his desk to be close to mine.  I then felt his hand on my thigh.  It felt good, but I was a bit scared.

“What if someone opens the door?” I asked.  Someone had done that once already.

“It’s okay,” he said.  “It’s pretty hidden.”

Even though I was more skeptical about anything romantic with Jonah, his touch felt like a spark that reignited those feelings again.  I held his hand in mine.

After the movie ended, I gave him a hug, and we kissed a few times.  I never thought I’d do anything like that on campus.

We cuddled in the back of the car and talked for a while.  We obviously made out too.  We made plans to go clothes shopping later in the week.

…

“Dang, he’s cute,” Tao said.  He and I were at a social gathering.  It seemed like that was everyone’s reaction when I showed a picture of Jonah.  Tao found out that he was in the same ward as Jonah.  “Are you interested in him?”

“Maybe, maybe not,” I answered.  “I like being around him, but I feel like communication has been pretty off.  I’d say that’s been his biggest red flag.”

“Does he know that you’re going to Dallas?”

“Yeah…  He knows.  The thing is, even though communication isn’t all the way there, I still like being around him.  I think he likes being around me too.  I’m kinda scared bringing up about Dallas so directly because I feel like everything will end there.”

“You’re afraid that he’ll say no?”

“Yeah.  And knowing myself, I don’t think long distance would work.  It’s hard to feel connected to people who are physically far away.”

“If you talk about it and he says no, at least you’ll know, right?”

I sighed.  “True, but it’s complicated.”  Graduation and moving to Dallas still felt pretty far away.

Section 4

February 20, 2024.  I asked Sister Okuda if she and I could call about some questions I had about my finances.  After some conversation, she told me that if I had questions that I should ask my professor or the TAs.

A few weeks ago, she and President Okuda told me that I was welcome to come back to Guam.  I was a bit confused and honestly didn’t feel comfortable considering that at this point, it seemed like if they didn’t talk about my sexual orientation that I would “phase out” of it eventually.  Sister Okuda again mentioned that I could come back to Guam before moving to Dallas.

“I don’t understand,” I said.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“I’m confused why you want me to come back.  Dad said some very hurtful things to me, and I don’t feel comfortable being around him.”

“I’m sorry if we said some hurtful things to you.”

“I don’t necessarily need an apology from you, more so from Dad.  And it’s not enough for him to just say sorry.  I want him to know why he should be sorry.”

“What did he say to you?” Sister Okuda asked.

“He never told you?”

“No.”

“Did you ever talk about things together?”

“He and I did talk about it once.  We agreed that even though you’re making decisions we may not necessarily agree with that we’re not in control of what you do.”

Sister Okuda and I talked some more.  I could tell that she still didn’t understand why I was choosing to date guys.  “And I don’t expect you to completely understand,” I continued.

“I think you’re still figuring things out for yourself, right?  What are you going to do about the Church?”

“I think people in the Church need to be better educated about the LGBTQ community.  I and many other LGBTQ people have felt peace and security from God about this side of us.  I don’t struggle with my relationship with God because of my sexual orientation.  I’ve prayed a lot about it, especially when I began dating guys.  I feel that God has made my sexual orientation a part of who I am just like with any other person.  What I struggle with is people who struggle with my sexual orientation.  I think it’s difficult for people to understand what we go through without listening to our perspectives.  When people who don’t know what we go through try to make themselves a voice without listening to our perspectives, it’s often wrong.”

I told Sister Okuda about Ben and Charlie’s podcast and gave some background about them.  I invited her to choose an episode whose title stood out to her and to listen to it.  I told her that I was down to talk about the episode and to listen to what she learned from it.

A few days later, she messaged me:

Sister Okuda: I looked through the titles of the podcast and I picked one and listened to half of it.

Me: What was it called?

Sister Okuda: I don’t remember the title

Me: What did you learn from it?

Sister Okuda: I listened to the guest and the hosts’ stories about them.

I wasn’t surprised by how emotionally lacking her response was.

Me: 99 percent of the time, the hosts have a guest, and they all share their stories. It doesn’t sound like you learned much from what you heard. For the next one you listen, let me know what the title of the episode is so I can listen to it too. And then we can video call sometime about what you learned and thoughts I had about that episode too.

She didn’t mention the podcast again.  As busy as I knew Sister Okuda was, it seemed like getting to know about this part of my life and possibly the lives of some of their missionaries wasn’t a priority.  She again didn’t provide the emotional support I hoped for.

A couple days later, President Okuda messaged me saying he wanted to call me.  Knowing Sister Okuda, she probably told him about my conversation with her.  I asked President Okuda what he wanted to call me about, and he said he wanted to talk about my plans after graduation.  I was fed up with his indirectness.  He had done something similar to me about my decision to date guys when he “warned” me not to be deceived.  I messaged him saying that I had bought tickets to Seattle and that I had reached out in a Facebook group about finding housing in Dallas.

“I’m not going to call him,” I told Tao that evening.  It was just the two of us eating dinner at a restaurant.

“You think you could be like, ‘Hey, do you want to talk about what happened after you responded to my blog?’”

“I feel like I’m the one who always has to initiate talking about this.  Not just this, but anything that can be emotionally charging.  He’s expressed his lack of support, so I’m not going to talk to him about it.  I know that a lot of people have told me that my dad is an amazing person, which I can see in some ways, and I don’t want to invalidate their experiences with him.  But I’ve had a really difficult time being emotionally vulnerable with my parents growing up, and coming out to them hasn’t been the first time that I haven’t felt care or support from them.”

I became more stoic, closed, and cold around my parents.  I lost my desire to be emotionally vulnerable to them.  And even if I had thoughts that things would have been better if I had been more emotionally open, my skepticism told me that I would regret it even more in the long run.

“Dang, I’m sorry,” Jonah said.  He and I were in the car parked at the mall.

For some reason, the subject came up again.  “Sorry, I honestly didn’t expect to tell you all of this,” I said.  “It’s not your problem.”

“No, no, no.  I’m here to listen.  Are you doing okay?”  He took my hand in his.

“I think I’ll be fine.”

“Coming out is a tough situation, especially when it comes to family.”  He told me about his family situation.

“Coming out to the wrong people is so scary, especially being at BYU.  Tell it to the wrong person, and there’s not much that can be done to feel safe and protected from being judged or discriminated against.  They say that they love and accept everyone, but I don’t feel that way, whether it’s because I’m Asian or gay or both.  Words don’t mean much to me.”

“I remember you saying that.”

We talked some more.

“Thanks for opening up to me,” Jonah said.  “I’m glad you trust me with that, and I’m sorry it’s been difficult.”

We then went into the mall and wandered around some of the clothes shops.

“H&M is a pretty good place,” Jonah said.  “Their clothes aren’t too expensive.”  He found something that caught his eye.  “Mm, love these.”  He picked up a pair of gray plaid pants that were the exact same as he was wearing.

“I like solid colors,” I said.  “Not as much of a fan of graphics.”

“I like black.  I think black would suit you too.  Or white.”

“I get scared of white.  I feel like they’d get dirty so easily.”

“You just gotta separate the white clothes when you’re doing your laundry.”

“I just throw everything into the same thing.  Saves money.”

“Really?  I guess to be fair, most of my clothes are black or white and not much in between.”

“I’d still wash everything together.”

“Noo!”  He and I laughed.

We went around the shops for a couple hours.  I really did enjoy spending time with Jonah.  Whether or not we talked to each other or did our own thing, I felt so comfortable around him.

He and I met usually once a week, sometimes twice, but I wished I could’ve seen him more frequently, even if it was short.  He and I did some homework another time, watched a movie at his place, played some games, went bowling, and did other fun things.  I asked if he’d be willing to take my graduation photos, to which he agreed.  I loved listening to him talk about his love for movies or when he’d want to sit closer to me or when we’d hold hands and snuggle.

As time passed, however, I realized that graduation and moving to Dallas were actually going to happen.  I knew that they would, but reality hadn’t struck me as much as it did by the time March rolled around.  Jonah was going to be doing a summer internship abroad, and he was going to leave in mid-May.  Neither one of us had talked about how things were going to look once summer began.

I wanted things to work out.  I really did.  I wanted to video call him and look forward to the time we could spend together.  The times that we’d get to see each other in person would be so precious.  But again, I knew myself well enough that a long-distance relationship was going to be difficult for me.  He still had two years of school left, and who knew where he’d end up.  Plus, a lot could happen in two years.  Two years ago, I wouldn’t have thought in a million years that I’d date guys.  Jonah and his ex did long-distance for a time, even though it sounded like Jonah didn’t feel much connection due to the lack of communication.

That was another reason why I didn’t think things would work out.  I felt like communication was still off when Jonah and I weren’t in person.  Considering that he said that he felt a lack of communication from his ex, Jonah should’ve known what he was doing.  Good communication was something I highly valued too.  I felt like the level of communication was going to backfire at some point.

After about a week of painful contemplation, I knew that someone would have to bring up about summer, so I decided to be the one to do it.  The logical side of me said that things probably weren’t going to work out, but the emotional side really wanted things to work out.  I knew that it was best to talk about these kinds of matters in person.  I texted him that I wanted to talk to him about something in a more private setting the next time I’d see him.  It depended on what Jonah would say about it.

Section 5

March 13, 2024.  I met Jonah at the library in the evening to do homework.  “How much stuff do you have tonight?” he asked.

“Not too much,” I answered, even though I had a paper to write for a midterm.  “What about you?”

“I’ve finished a lot of what I need to do.  Would it be okay if we leave a bit early?”

I wasn’t sure if he was just as nervous as I was about defining the relationship, even though he didn’t know that that was what I wanted to talk to him about.  Or maybe he just didn’t care much about the situation.

For the next half hour, I did some homework while he did some voice recordings in a different language.

“I’ve never heard you speak that much,” I said as he and I walked out of the library to my car.

“I haven’t spoken that much either, but you pick it back up after you speak it a little,” he said.

“I wish I knew a second language fluently.”

“You know Japanese and Korean.  You’re basically trilingual.”

I laughed.  “I’m definitely not fluent in Korean, and my Japanese is like at a kindergarten level.  What were you talking about?”

He and I talked like usual.  When I finally got to his place, I was nervous, but I knew I had to bring up the subject.

“I know I told you that I wanted to talk to you about something more in private,” I said.  “I want to do a DTR.”

"I agree," he said.

"I can go first.  I really like spending time with you, and I think you're really cute, but... I know that in a couple months, you'll be leaving abroad, and then I'll be moving to Dallas.  I’m not sure what’s going to happen when summer arrives.  What are your thoughts about that?"

"I've honestly been thinking about that on basically every single date we've had.  I'm totally open to being friends with you, and I'm still down to take your graduation pictures.  I've loved getting to know you and spending time with you, and I think you're super attractive.  You're definitely a lot more attractive in person.  I've loved getting to hear your perspectives about all of the things we've talked about, and I feel like I've learned a lot from you, especially about the Church.  You have a good balance between both the Church and your dating life, and I think I realized that the gospel is something that I can still love.  And you've got so much ahead of you!  You're going to be a working adult.  You've got a good job.  Statistically speaking, you're 100 percent gonna rock your future.  I know you'll find someone there who'll make you so happy."

It stung when he said that we could be friends.  I wanted things to work out with him.  I really wanted to have that long-distance relationship where we'd video call every night and we'd talk and laugh about random things.  I really wanted to have the excitement of flying out to see him every now and then and getting to spend that precious time in person.  I really wished that in a couple years from now, he could get a job in Dallas and that he'd move somewhere close to me.  And after two years of separation, we'd be able to build a happy life together.  “I wish we could’ve spent more time together,” I said, “but at the same time, I was also scared about spending more time together with the knowledge that I’ll be moving and the uncertainty of what that means for us.”

We talked some more.

"Can I give you a hug before I leave?" Jonah asked when we finished talking.

"Yeah," I answered.  And we hugged for at least a solid five minutes.  I savored every second of that romantic embrace.

"You give really good hugs," Jonah said as we continued to embrace.

"I really wanna cuddle with you," I responded.

He chuckled and put my hand in his as we gave each other our last kisses.  As he got out of the car, my mouth and my throat naturally wanted to say, "I love you."  I was shocked that my body did that.  I didn't know the last time when I said those words without fear or insincerity.  But I knew that those words were meaningless, and I withheld them.

"Thank you," he smiled.  "Thank you for everything."  And with that, he got out of the car and shut the door.

On the drive home, I thought about the first date when I played “Clair de Lune.”  I thought about the time we took pictures and watched movies and clothes shopped and the night when we first held hands.  All the memories flashed in my mind.  I played Blackpink's "Playing with Fire" on repeat and blasted it while driving home.  (Consider it my theme song for the school year.)

When I turned off the engine, I felt as if something inside me had been taken away.  I lost something.  I lost Jonah, at least the potential to further pursue my romantic interest in him.  The feeling of loss was so familiar, the feeling of being heartbroken.  From previous experience, I just needed a couple of weeks.  I knew the first few days were going to be extremely difficult, but time would heal.  Just a couple weeks would be enough time to get over these feelings.

Or so I thought.
