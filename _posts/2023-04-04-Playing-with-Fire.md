## Section 1

December 3, 2022.  Just as Gyuna had told me on the phone, she went to Rexburg today.  It was weird not getting to see her over the weekend.  I didn’t hang out with anyone else that much outside of class.  Since I didn’t know what else to do, I went to the Engineering Building to study.  I felt super lonely.  I couldn’t believe I lived a life of solitude like this last school year.  I didn’t know how I did it.

I had been messaging a guy named Peter for about a week.  He asked me how I was doing during this particular moment.  I said that I felt a bit lonely without my friend for the weekend, so he asked me if I was available to go on a date!  I honestly didn’t think he was that interested, but I was down.

The next day, I drove up to Liberty Park in Salt Lake City.  It was the first time I had driven to Salt Lake City by myself, so I was a bit nervous.  And I was nervous that I was going on another first date.  I sometimes still got SO freaking nervous, especially on first dates.

When I got to Liberty Park, I got a text from him with a pin dropped of his location.  "Hey!  Michael, right?" he greeted.

"Yeah!  Peter?"

"Yep!  Nice to meet you!"  He gave me a one-arm hug and caressed my back.

We walked around the park and got to know each other.  He graduated from BYU in 2016 and was a software engineer.  His parents were in Hong Kong on an 18-month mission, and he had grown up in Salt Lake.  Over Tinder, he told me that he had left the Church three years ago.  Peter was the first person I went on a date with who left the Church.  On the mission, I tried visiting lots of less-active members, but some of them were pretty rude and didn’t want anything to do with us.  I had my own assumptions about why LGBTQ members left the Church, but I wanted to learn from actual individuals why they left.

“I served my mission in Guatemala,” he said in the middle of the conversation.  “I don’t keep up my Spanish much, but I’ve found it useful.  Sometimes I can understand what people are saying, and I can speak back.”

“I served in a Korean branch for about seven months, but I didn’t pick it up well,” I said.  “My parents are Japanese, but I can’t say I know much Japanese either.  I wish I knew.”

“So what are you studying at BYU?”

“I’m studying statistics.  I’m hoping to do data science, so I plan on doing a master’s degree at some point.  It depends on my summer internship.  I got a position as a data analyst intern at AT&T in Dallas, so if I get a full-time offer, I’ll accept it since they’ll pay for my graduate school.”

“Yeah, I could see why getting a master’s degree would be useful for data science.  At least for computer science, there are so many job opportunities out there that a bachelor's degree is enough unless you want to go into teaching or something like that.”  I learned that he interned at Google for a couple summers, so he must have been really smart.

Lately, I had been trying to focus more on people’s bios than their pictures when I was swiping, and while I didn’t find Peter to be extremely good-looking, I was attracted to his personality.  He was easy to talk to, and he knew my love language was having conversation.  He occasionally swatted his hand against my arm in a flirty way.  I could kind of tell he had a thing for me ever since he and I first met.

It was starting to get dark and cold, so we decided to go to the Gateway Mall to eat dinner.  He paid for my meal, which was super nice.

“So what got you started dating guys?” Peter asked when we sat down.  “I’m sure it’s difficult to date guys at BYU.”

I told him my story, which took about half an hour.  He and I didn’t touch our food the entire time.  “Looking back, I remember having feelings for a guy when I was seven, but I didn’t think much of it.  But then when I was ten, that was when I really started to notice an attraction towards guys.  But I suppressed and denied those feelings as a teenager.  I thought that maybe my feelings would change, but they obviously never did.  I did go on dates with girls, but they all felt like hanging out.  I went to BYU for a year before my mission, and when I saw what the dating culture was like there and what dating REALLY was like, that was when I sort of realized that I didn’t want to date girls like that.  I had no desire to touch girls like couples did on campus.  And when people asked me why I was opposed to going on dates, I told them that I had a mission to serve.  Plus, I thought that romantic feelings were bad anyway.  Then I went on my mission, and nothing about my feelings changed.  I still suppressed them, so it wasn’t a big deal to me.  The way that elders and sisters are separated made me even less interested in wanting to even talk to girls, and that was when I definitely learned that I had no interest in dating girls.  So when I came back from my mission, dating and marriage seemed like a non-existent thing for me.  I had zero interest in dating girls, and no one was interested in dating me, which I guess was fine.  At the beginning of this year, I began to think that I’d live to be single my entire life.”

“Aw!  That’s sad, Michael!” Peter expressed.

_(November 8, 2022; college junior) “Aww, that’s really sad!” Kent exclaimed._

_..._

_(November 13, 2022; college junior) “Aww, Michael!  That’s really sad!” Gyuna exclaimed._

Initially, I didn’t realize how miserable living to be single for the rest of my life would be, but the more I thought about it, it definitely was sad.  No wonder people reacted with pity.

“This semester, though, I have a friend who served in Seattle with me, and she transferred to BYU from BYU-Idaho,” I continued.  “I didn’t have any friends, but she reached out to me, and we hang out a lot now.  But I noticed that I’d feel these withdrawals when I didn’t hang out with her.  Growing up, I’ve always felt a hollow space inside me, as if something in my life were missing, and I thought that maybe the thing that would help fill it would be a relationship.  I have zero desire to be in a relationship with a girl, so I thought I’d give dating guys a chance.  I prayed a lot about it, and I didn’t feel like I got any ‘no’ or sign from God not to date guys, so I started using dating apps around the end of October.  And it’s been a ROLLER COASTER of emotions!  But I’ve grown so much and have discovered so many things about dating and feelings and empathizing with others that so far, I want to continue dating guys.  In a way, I feel like I missed out on a lot not dating guys earlier.”

“Well, I didn’t come out until I was 26,” Peter said.  He was 31 now.  “But I can relate to where you come from.  When I was a teenager, I thought about getting married to a girl and having kids, but I never had feelings for girls.  And I especially started to notice that I had feelings toward guys when I was 17 or 18.  I was definitely closeted when I was at BYU though.  I lived in California for a few years, and my bishop was like, ‘So, Peter, I’ve noticed that you haven’t been dating anyone, and you’re getting up there in age.’  So that was when I came out.  All of us in the ward had a feeling he was gay, but he was married and had kids.  You know, he’s a bishop in California, so he didn’t say anything to make me feel like I was a bad person or that I did something wrong.  He told me that I should think carefully about how to deal with these feelings.  I know he stayed in the Church, but for me, I felt like in order for me to date guys, I couldn’t be part of the Church anymore.  So I came out to my parents.  And then to my siblings.  I guess there are two stages of coming out.  The first is that you tell people that you’re attracted to guys.  I feel like most people are totally fine with that.  But the second stage is telling people that you’re dating guys, and that’s when people can feel uncomfortable.  But my parents want me to be happy, and they’re still supportive of me.  I mean, I’m taking care of the house while they’re gone, so I guess it shows how much they still trust me.  But it’s been three years since I left the Church, and I’ve never felt happier getting to date guys.  I feel like there are many LGBTQ members who leave the Church.  Religion can sometimes be looked down upon in the gay community, so it’s harder to find people if you’re associated with it.”

I still didn’t think that faith and feelings were black and white, that I could choose only one thing and leave the other behind.  It sort of implied that all gay people inevitably would have to throw away faith because sexual orientation wasn’t something anyone could control.  I couldn’t imagine throwing away something that was so valuable and positively influential in my life, especially if I were to throw it away just so I could blend in with the gay community.

“Even though I didn’t date girls much, I had a close friend who was really awesome,” Peter continued.  “She checked all the boxes: she was really smart, she had a great personality, she was super nice.  But I had no desire to marry her.”

For some reason, his description of his friend made me think of Carli. She was smart.  She was sweet.  And people said she was pretty.  But I definitely had no desire to date or marry her.

After we ate, we went to his parents’ house and watched a British cooking show.  I told him that I wanted to get more educated with movies and TV shows.

"Do you wanna cuddle?" he asked.

I kind of liked him, so I actually wanted to cuddle.  "Sure," I answered.  "I've never cuddled before though."  It was true; I didn’t reciprocate cuddling with John.

Peter taught me how to cuddle, and we switched around on occasion.  So this was what it was like to cuddle someone that I wanted to cuddle with.  It did feel nice.

"Your heart is racing so fast," Peter said.

I kind of laughed.  "I mean... yeah."

After the show was over, we cuddled in silence.  My heart was still racing.  I really wanted to kiss him, but I wasn’t sure how to ask.  "What are you thinking?" I decided to ask.

"I don't know,” he responded.  “What are you thinking?"

"I kinda wanna kiss you."

So we did and ended up making out.  But instead of feeling disgusted, I actually liked it!  We just cuddled for about another hour or so after that.

"I could probably fall asleep, but my brain is also like, 'My car!'"  I had left my car at Liberty Park.

"Yeah, I need to get you back to your car,” Peter said.  “Also, I have a friend who was in a relationship for two weeks but then broke up, so I'm going to talk to him after I drop you off.  He and I will probably go to a club.  You can join if you want, but I’ll warn you that if you join, he’ll probably try to make you drink."  He got out a bottle of wine from underneath the table.  “I’m going to give this to him as a gift.  He’s been having a tough time coping with this situation.”

I didn’t want to stay up too late, and I didn’t have any desire to drink.  Alcohol had never been a temptation for me.

We ended up planning for another date next week.  Peter said we could go on a hike.  "I know you're looking for a long-term relationship, but I don't want you to become too attached to me,” he said.  “We're kinda in different stages of our lives, and I'm kind of commit-ophobic."

When he dropped me off at Liberty Park, he and I gave each other a hug and a kiss.  I honestly felt a lot safer in Salt Lake than Provo with PDA, so I didn’t mind it.  Plus, it was dark.  I was excited for my date with him next week.

...

December 4, 2022.

```Me:  I’ll have to tell you more about yesterday, but basically there’s this guy I had been texting for about a week, and he reached out to me on Friday evening asking how my weekend was going, and I told him I was feeling pretty lonely without you. I can’t believe I lived this kind of life of being by myself on campus last school year, but he invited me to go on a date! Lol that’s how I ended up getting to go yesterday. I drove up to SLC to meet him. He’s eight years older than me, and he was fine over text and in pics, but I liked his personality. He’s a software engineer and is really smart. I just thought about you and was thinking, Could you adopt me?```

```Idk if there’s gonna be any kind of commitment because he’s much older than me and is in a different stage of life, but we’re planning on meeting back up on Thursday.```

```Gyuna: Awwwweeeeeeeee that’s cuteeeeeeeeeeeee```

```Did you say that to his face could you adopt me?? That would have been so sooooo cute u learned something good from me lol```

```And you miss me look at you missing your bf```

```Me: Lolol, if I had a boyfriend, maybe I wouldn’t end up missing my best friend as much```

```Gyuna: Hey I still missed you up here in Rexburg```

```But I got my physical touch and love that I needed that you don’t give me lol```

```Me: Lolol. I got some physical touch from my date yesterday.```

```And I actually didn’t mind it.```

```Gyuna: DANG```

```WHAT KIND?```

```Me: Uh lol```

```Well, we cuddled.```

```And we ended up making out.```

```Oh my gosh, I can’t believe I’m telling you that.```

```Gyuna: WHAT?????????????????```

```To tbtirbtridusbsbrirhd```

```Brorbehsisjnsgeowksbds```

```Dbrhskaoquegbsnaizyy go xa```

```Fucnckcnx```

```For rrralllllllll?????????```

```Me: The thing though is that Idk if this is going to be a long term thing.```

```So... Idk```

```Gyuna: Hey you made out```

```That's all that matters for now```

```Me: Yeah. It happened```

```Gyuna: What the helllllllllllllllllllpoppoooooooooopp```

```Did you like it?????```

```Bro brobtirbrrobrorrbrorbo```

```What rhebshsusyys```

```Me: Haha yeah```

I invited Gyuna to my FHE.  I usually didn’t go anymore these days, but a ward Christmas party was happening at my bishop’s place, so I knew Gyuna would be happy to have free food.  Plus, it had been five whole days since we last saw each other.

“So how was the make-out session?” Gyuna asked first thing when she got into the car.

I laughed.  “It was good,” I answered.  I told her the whole story.  “...and we were just watching a British cooking show, and my heart was racing so fast.  The show was about an hour long, so I waited until after the show finished.”

“You know, when you watch a movie, you don’t see a thing cuz you’re too busy making out.”

She and I laughed.  “Well, I didn’t want to be rude and not watch the show.  But I’m not entirely sure how I feel about him.  He said he’s not the kind of person to be committed.  But plot twist.  Peter wasn’t my first kiss.”

“WHAT?!!!”

“My first kiss was John.”

“John?!!!  Why didn’t you tell me?!”

“I was kind of scared.  I wasn't into him anyway, so I kinda regret that he was my first kiss.  But I liked Peter.  I liked his personality, and he was really sweet.  And if he’d be willing to adopt me, I might take up on it since he and his family are pretty bougie.”

“Wow, Michael’s a ho!”

When Gyuna and I went to the activity, we sat down at a table with some other people from the ward.  They said hi to me in line and decided to join me at the table, which I guess was nice.  We didn't really talk to each other though.

"Is that a taco Christmas sweater?" Gyuna asked one of the guys.  I was surprised that she initiated a conversation.  I knew she was a people-person, but I knew she found white people intimidating.  She introduced herself to a few of the people at the table, but then they kind of went back to having their own conversation amongst themselves.  I was glad that Gyuna came with me.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have attended the activity, even if there was food.

"I just don't get white people," Gyuna said after the activity.  "They form their own little groups, and they didn't even talk to us that much."

"I mean, isn't that pretty normal?" I asked.

"It shouldn't be normal.  Sorry, but your ward sucks.  If this is what all YSA wards are like, I'd honestly probably leave the Church."

"But church isn't about making friends.  It's about building your relationship with God.  My ward last year sucked.  I didn't have any friends.  If church was all about making friends, I definitely wouldn't have gone to church."

"But it's the people that make such a big difference."

"Yeah, it sucks to not feel networked among the people, but in those kinds of circumstances, you just have to change your perspective."  I knew that being in the Asian community was different.  People seemed a lot more approachable and inclusive, especially when I hung out with Gyuna’s friends or Hyeji and her friends.

We dipped a little early since no one really talked to us.  We decided to go to a park to see Christmas lights and took some pictures there.  A couple was walking around that probably thought Gyuna and I were dating, and the woman offered to take our picture.  We posed in front of a giant Christmas tree while Gyuna held onto my wrist.  The couple also asked if we could take their picture, and they made actual couple poses.

"They probably thought we were dating," I said.

“Yeah, well, you can see in the picture that I'm holding your wrist,” Gyuna said.  We looked at the couple as they walked off into the distance, holding hands.  “See? That's what a couple does.  But you know, I hope you’re not offended by me saying this, but I’ve always wanted to have a gay best friend.”

I laughed.  “Why?”

“Because when I go clothes shopping, I can ask, ‘What do you think?’ and not actually get hit on.  But you’re not a fashionable person, so I guess you don’t count.”

## Section 2

December 8, 2022.  I went on a second date with Trevor the other day and had dinner at a Brazilian grill restaurant at the Riverwoods Mall.  He was running quite a bit late due to traffic and the snow, so I waited for about 45 minutes before he showed up.

By the time we finished eating, I had to go since I told Gyuna that I planned on meeting with her to go over a data science lab.  I felt kind of bad for leaving Trevor like that, even though the date began later than expected.  Plus, I still didn’t feel anything romantic.  Even though it didn’t work out, we connected on social media.

...

I had my second date with Peter today.  I realized that second dates were sometimes more nerve-wracking than first dates.  With a first date, I didn’t know the person, so I could ask a bunch of questions to get to know the guy.  But I had a harder time knowing what to ask after that.  It was almost a similar scenario of hanging out with the same person frequently and not knowing what to talk about.  With Gyuna, she always had something to talk about, so she was an exception.  I hoped the date wouldn’t feel awkward.

Actually, a couple days ago, Peter texted me saying that he might get into a serious relationship with someone else and wasn't sure how I'd feel about going on another date.  I did feel a bit emotionally broken, but as I thought about the kind of person he was and his lifestyle, I felt like things would end up clashing with my lifestyle.  So maybe it wouldn't have ended up working out anyway.  I was just surprised that he thought about getting serious with someone else since he told me he was commit-ophobic.

After another long drive up to Salt Lake, I met him at his house.  We hiked a trail called the living room trail not too far away.

“I actually found an email from Nozomu a long time ago,” Peter said as he showed me the email.  Nozomu was only a couple years older than Peter, and since they both majored in CS, maybe they knew each other.  “I didn’t remember his name, but I did find this email.  He was one of the people who home-taught me.  I was really antisocial in college, so I don’t remember too many people.”

I read the first sentence of the email.  “‘I hope you are Peter.’”  I laughed.  “That sounds so Nozomu.  He didn’t sound like he had much of a social life either.”

“In college, I was locked up in my room almost all the time.  It wasn’t until I went to BYU Jerusalem before my senior year when I felt like I made friends.  I’m definitely an introvert by nature.”

“You don’t seem like an antisocial person.  I’d consider myself an introvert too.  I know some people like you who say they’d lock themselves in their room for some quiet time if they ever had to be around large groups of people, but I wouldn’t say I’d go to that extreme.  I definitely don’t like being in my apartment during the daytime.  I like being on campus with other people around me when I’m studying as long as it’s quiet.”

We finally reached the bottom of the trail and made our way up.  “So who’s this person you’re thinking you’d get serious with?” I asked.

“I met him on Tinder,” Peter answered.  “He’s a couple years older than me and is living in Lehi.  He’s an art teacher, and he’s really nerdy, which I like those kinds of guys.  He’s been in only one relationship, which worries me considering how old he is.”

“I mean, I’ve never been in a relationship, and I’m 23.”

“Well, you’re ten years younger than him.  A lot can happen in ten years.  He also left the Church, so he and I talked about our stories and related to each other.  Many of us gay members end up leaving the Church.”

Occasionally, Peter and I took a water break.  Sometimes he embraced me in his arms, and I hugged him back.  It did feel good.  When we reached the end of the trail, I saw some interesting-looking chairs and a couple of wooden tables.  I guess it did look like a living room.  Peter and I sat in the chairs.

“What would you say are your biggest fears?” I asked.

"Hm, I’d say for me, I’m not a fan of the dark,” Peter answered.

“Like the nighttime?  Or walking down a dark hallway?”

“Yeah, both.  For some reason, that’s always been a fear of mine.  I think a more serious fear I have is death.”  It made sense.

"I'd be scared of dying too," I said.

"I'm the kind of person who doesn't really think something is real until I see it, so I have no idea what will happen after I die."

I was surprised.  "So do you believe that there’s some sort of life after this one, or do you believe that it's basically the end after this life?”

"I don't know.  I'd probably lean more towards thinking that once I die, it's the end."

I still had a hard time comprehending what he said.  He had been a missionary teaching people about the plan of salvation.  What got him to believe that death was the end, as if a blackness fell upon those who died?  "So I guess what are you hoping to do before that end happens?" I asked.

"That's a good question.  I definitely want to live a good life."

"What do you find to be a good life?"

"I just want to be a good person and be the best that I can be."  He was pretty general about his goals.  I guess it would be hard to know what the point of life was if everything was going to come to a halting end at death.  "You know how in video games, if you end up dying like in a Zelda game, you can restart from where you last saved,” Peter continued.  “But in real life, you can't do that.  I definitely don't like making mistakes."

"Well, I haven't met anyone who's perfect.  But I think making mistakes is part of life.  As long as we learn from it and move on, I think that's our way of restarting."

"Hm, you make a good point."

I felt like I was giving a gospel lesson about repentance.  Did he not make that connection?

“Well, let’s head back down,” Peter said.  “It’s getting cold and dark pretty fast.”

“Yeah, better get down before you get too scared of the dark.”

We headed down the trail.

“So you told me that you haven’t come out to your family, right?” Peter asked.

“Yeah, just my best friend,” I answered.

“What makes you hesitant about coming out to your family if you don’t mind me asking?”

“I honestly haven’t felt like it’s right to tell them, even though I’ve thought a lot about coming out to them.  I think I’d tell my parents first, but I could definitely see my mom telling everyone else in the family, so I feel like it should be no one or everyone when I come out.  I should be the one telling that story.  Even though it was scary to tell my best friend, I felt like it was right for me to tell her when I did.  Plus, my family isn’t really my go-to when I want to talk about concerns or problems.”

“How do you think your parents would react if you told them?”

“Hm…  I don’t know.  They’re not very expressive.  In the past, I feel like when I’ve gone to them for help with life situations, they don’t seem to care that much unless it affects their reputation.  My dad was a stake president when I was in middle school and high school, and he’s a mission president now.  Maybe they’ll care because ‘the mission president’s son’ is gay.  But I honestly don’t know.  I don’t see them kicking me out of the family, but I could see them not caring or not being supportive.”

“Do your parents show affection at all?”

“I mean, I guess thinking about it, sometimes my dad will hug my mom.”

“Well, of course, they love each other, don’t they?  My parents have been the same way with me about being more expressive.”

“Yeah, my parents just aren’t that expressive, especially when it comes to deeper matters.  They never taught me things like why polygamy was a thing or how blacks weren’t allowed the priesthood for a period of time.  I learned those on the mission and in my religion classes.”

“Yeah, my grandma told me that she had some neighbors who were black, and when the missionaries came by one time, she told her parents about how the missionaries could visit the black neighbors.  But it seemed like even teaching the gospel to black people was pretty limited since my grandma’s parents were like, ‘Oh no, not them.’”

“The more time passes, the more I realize how much I don’t know my parents’ lives.”

We headed to a restaurant to eat some pizza and Italian food.  It was a semi-bougie place, and again, Peter paid for everything.  He taught me some basic CS concepts, stuff that I didn't learn in my beginning CS class.  I also ended up talking about Kent for some reason.

“I think back on that experience, and I kind of laugh,” I continued.  “He was probably like, ‘He’s too young and too quick with his feelings.  I need to find someone else.’  And I probably was a bit quick.  But I had never felt the way that I did.  Ever.  And he brought out a side of me that I didn’t think I had in me.  I’ve been changed for the better.  So I think that’s why I’m still continuing to date guys.”

After we finished eating, we went back to his house and played a few card games.  I also noticed a grand piano in the living room.  “Do you play the piano?” I asked.

“Not really,” Peter answered.  “It hasn’t been played in a while.  I can read one hand, but that’s basically it.  I wish I knew more about music.”  He opened the hymn book to a Christmas song and played with one hand.  “Do you play?”

“Yeah!  I’d be down to play something.”  I played the Fantaisie Impromptu.

My dates with Peter were fun, but I didn’t think things would work out values-wise.  It ended up being the last time I saw him.  But I thought a lot about what he and I had talked about on the hike.  Exaltation was the goal, but what was it like to live during the Great Apostasy?  If there wasn’t a true church, then people would have had to find a way to make the best of the situation.  Of course, it was easy for people these days to say that we could do proxy work for them in the temple, but the people back then didn’t know anything about that.  What hope did they have?  Or, in more recent times, how did black people keep their faith in the gospel?

I wondered what it would’ve been like being a black person in the 1950s.  When would have been the point that a black child would have realized that he/she was part of a group that was treated less—the Minority?

I also wondered what it would’ve been like being a white person in the 1950s.  At least from what I had learned in school, black people certainly were not as well-educated; black schools were not as well-funded as white schools.  And due to lack of education, there were probably less opportunities for what jobs black people were able to pursue.  They probably received only the minimum.  They were of poor socioeconomic status, and that cycle continued as those black people raised families of their own.  It was just a feedback loop that continually put them at a disadvantage.

For a white child to grow up in a society where being white was definitely a privilege and part of the Majority, no wonder they would’ve seen black people as inferior.  White people had better education, more job opportunities, and better-paying jobs.  That was the society they and many generations before them lived in.  It wasn’t like black people could do anything to easily convince white people that black people were just as worthy of rights and opportunities when the way that white people saw the world was painted with privilege.

I also wondered what it would have been like being a black member and a white member in the 1950s.  Black people couldn’t go through the temple or receive the priesthood during that time, which also implied that they couldn’t receive exaltation.  Of course, it’s easy to look back in retrospect and say that anyone can enjoy the blessings of the priesthood now, but <u>how did black members back then keep to the faith?</u>  It must have been pretty normal to receive discouraging news like that living in a society where black people were treated poorly anyway.

White members who had hopes for exaltation probably thought black people weren’t dating material.  What was the point of marrying a black person if the marriage couldn’t last into the eternities?  Plus, interracial marriages back then were considered taboo in society.  I had read a few accounts of black people being turned down for receiving their endowments.  I wondered what that interview would’ve been like.  “Look at you, you’re black,” I could’ve heard the bishop say.  Or maybe he would’ve awkwardly tried to hint the obvious but not actually address the reason.

I also wondered what it would’ve been like being black when segregation was ruled unconstitutional.  I heard how it was quite an adjustment for white people.  The society that white people lived in for several generations changed.  How could these black, inferior creatures be raised to a status equal to the white society?  These black creatures would pollute the country and take over jobs.

I realized that—in some ways—I was like a black person in the 1950s.  The gay community was part of the Minority.  I had heard many people especially in the religious community say that this world was getting more evil because gay people were perverting people’s morals.  Maybe that was how white people felt about black people.  I could’ve gone through the motions of going through the ritual of marriage with a human being who had XY chromosomes, but I knew that I didn’t have to go down that route to realize how detrimental it would be to all involved.  And sure, some gay people could do it.  I was pretty sure that if God commanded marriage between man and man or woman and woman and created them so that they could reproduce with only the same gender that straight people would realize that they couldn’t just change their sexual orientation or their desire for the opposite gender.  Their sexuality was something they took for granted.  If straight people were in a situation similar to gay people, some may choose to marry the same gender, some may remain celibate, but most would leave the Church.  The pattern would’ve been the same.

Similarly, it wasn’t like black people could paint themselves white so they could be considered “white.”  Gay people couldn’t paint themselves straight either.  <u>Being straight was definitely a privilege.</u>  I heard straight people wonder why gay people talked so much about sexuality, but talking about dating or marriage or liking someone implied sexuality.  Straight people just took it for granted; it was a privilege that they could talk so openly about it without feeling vulnerable, especially at BYU.  They probably would’ve made a fuss too if they were told that they had to live like a missionary their entire lives—no dating or marriage or heterosexual acts.

Maybe so many gay members left the Church because what was the point of keeping the commandments and making covenants if exaltation wasn’t a realistic goal?  I could understand that feeling of hopelessness.  I had also heard a lot of stories about gay members feeling marginalized for not being part of the Majority.  I could also somewhat relate to that looking like an Asian at BYU.  I wondered if black people in the 1950s had similar questions about the state of their souls in the eternities.  That probably didn’t discourage them to have families of their own just like people today who weren’t interested in the gospel had families of their own, even if they knew that they’d part at death.  It seemed like the feelings and the desire of creating a family surpassed the knowledge of the inevitable—the sorrow of separation at death.  From a mechanical perspective, it was intriguing to think why people would inflict such pain on themselves.  So what did black people do to keep to the faith when they realized that their skin color and heritage were the reasons they couldn’t receive exaltation?

"Three years of being less active is a long time,” Gyuna said.  She and I were walking to a taco restaurant for a late dinner.  “I think some people try to shove those memories of spiritual experiences from themselves.  They don’t want to remember.”  I had told her about Peter and how I felt like things wouldn’t have worked out with him, even if he wasn’t thinking about being in a relationship with someone else.

“"It's really sad,” I said.  “I wonder what kept him going on a mission for the whole two years.  But I think I can understand why so many gay members leave the Church.  I’ve thought a lot about exaltation.  I don’t know if I’ll get to be with my family after this life.  I mean, I guess I don’t talk to them that much.  Even though my sister lives only 15 minutes away, I don’t see her that often.  My brother-in-law and his family don’t really talk to me at all, but the idea of being with my family forever sounds desirable."

"I've asked my Book of Mormon professor questions about the state of the soul or what happens when we're judged.  And my professor gave me some things that we'll be judged for, and I wrote them down.  God will judge us according to our works, our desires, our obedience to His commandments, our recordkeeping.  Those are just a few.  But God knows the desires of your heart.  <u>I think that’s why receiving personal revelation is so important because it’s specifically for YOU.  God knows you better than anyone else.</u>”

“You know, I did pray a lot before I started downloading dating apps to see if this was the right thing for me.  I never got a ‘no’ or a bad feeling about it.  And honestly, I feel like I’ve grown so much from dating guys.  It’s just confusing when people say that this kind of thing is a sin when I feel the opposite way.  I’m sure I feel just as happy dating guys as straight people are happy dating those of the opposite gender.”

Gyuna and I headed back to the library to study.  We mostly just talked until the library closed at 2am.  She shared some personal spiritual experiences from the MTC.  They probably would've sounded like hallucinations to someone who didn't understand or have spiritual experiences.

<u>One thing I noticed was that people often found that being gay and being religious were complete opposites.</u>  Being gay was a Minority in the religious community, and being religious was a Minority in the gay community.  <u>But one thing I learned was that trying to describe a spiritual experience to someone who never had such experiences probably would’ve sounded delusional to that person.  The same thing applied with trying to describe what it was like being gay to someone who was straight or who didn’t know what romantic feelings were.  Hearing a voice in your head telling you to do something and calling that the Spirit?  Or a guy kissing another guy and saying that it felt amazing?  Of course someone who didn’t understand would call either of those situations delusional.</u>

"Don't forget them,” I said when Gyuna finished sharing her spiritual experiences.  “Always remember those experiences, especially when faith is difficult to hold onto."  That was one thing that I was pretty good at: remembering.

Around this time, I found a podcast where people in the LGBTQ community talked about their experiences being a member of the Church.  One of the episodes was a guy who talked about personal revelation.  After listening to what he had to say, my situation of not receiving a “no” from God made more sense.  (I’ve never met or talked to this guy before, but he talks about his story [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-416-connor-berg-rm-age-22-gay-latter-day-saint/id1347971725?i=1000523866703).)

## Section 3

December 16, 2022.  The semester was finally over.  Hyeji and I studied a lot together, mostly her wanting to ask for help with STAT 240.  She invited some of her friends and me to her place for an end-of-the-semester celebration.

She got out some fancy cake for dessert and told me about this one guy in our major whom she had feelings for.  After a long and complicated story, she said she wanted to put closure and do something nice for him, so she bought this fancy cake to celebrate his birthday.  “He didn’t show up!” she continued.  “So that’s why I have this cake.  I wanted to do something nice for him, but he didn’t communicate.  Isn’t he a jerk?”

“Well, I’d like to get his point of view,” I said.  “I want to know his side of the story.”

“I just need people to agree with me that he’s a jerk.”

“Do you still have feelings for him?”

“More like a friend.  But at the same time, I’m scared that I’ll never have feelings for another guy like I did with him.”

I was sure dating was complicated for straight people too.  At this point, I was going on about two dates a week.  I spent a LOT of time on dating apps.  Thinking about how much time I spent on them made me feel a bit ashamed.  But dating was such a priority for me at this point.

I had matched with a guy who had served in the same mission as me.  His name was Carl.  I was surprised when I saw his profile.  I didn’t know him that much, as he and I had never served in the same zone together.  But he wasn’t a bad-looking guy.  I asked him if we could meet, so we met on the main floor of the library.

“I knew there had to be someone else in the mission!” Carl said in the middle of our conversation.

“Yeah, I definitely kept those feelings deeply suppressed though,” I said.  “Dating guys never crossed my mind until about a month ago.”

“I was actually writing to a girl during my mission.  When I came home, my parents set me up on a date with her.  I broke up with her after that date.  I started using dating apps soon after that, and I dated a guy named Will for a few months.  He and I actually thought about getting married.”

I had never heard about a gay couple at BYU thinking about getting married.  “You dated a guy?  Are you not dating him anymore?”

“No.  It’s kind of a long story.  Before Thanksgiving break, he and I had talked about praying if marriage would’ve been right.  You know, we’d cuddle together for scripture study and then pray afterwards.  We went on our vacations during Thanksgiving break, and we hadn’t seen each other for a week and a half.  That was the longest he and I hadn’t seen each other ever since we met.  After break, he told me that he felt that we needed to break up.  He said he feels that he should try to date and marry a girl.  He’s bi.  I was shocked though.  I didn’t receive an answer like that.  If an angel had come down and told me or something, I probably would’ve been more okay with it, but I’ve been absolutely heartbroken for the past couple weeks.”

“Dang, that sucks.  Do you still talk to him?”

“No.  Even after he talked about breaking up, he held my hand, and that was when he felt like we needed to cut each other off.  So we’re not even friends.”

“What would you have done if you two did get married?”

“For me, since it’s only my first semester, I probably would’ve transferred to UVU.  It would’ve been a bit harder for Will since he’s in the advertising program.  But marriage isn’t a thing anymore.”

Carl invited me to go swing dancing with him.  He said that he used to swing dance a lot and needed to do something to relieve stress.  He said I could join, so I decided to take up his offer.  But I didn’t feel that respected.  He was definitely a talker, which I didn’t mind, but I didn’t feel like he cared about what I said when I said anything.  He would also openly message guys on Tinder.  I knew that having a rational mind was hard in the middle of a heartbreak, but I wished he could’ve been more respectful.  It definitely made me feel less interested in him.

On another occasion, I met a guy named Aaron.  He brought one of his friends, who was bi, and the three of us went to DI.  Aaron was studying film, and he needed to do some shots for a project in his class.  He and I ended up going on a date the following week.  We ate at a barbecue restaurant and then went on a walk in the park where Gyuna and I had taken pictures.  He texted me saying he didn’t feel anything romantic, and I honestly didn’t feel anything romantic either.  But he invited me to window shop with his friends up in Draper the following day.  So that was where I went.  I did want to meet people in the gay community and make friends, so I thought it would be a great opportunity.

Aaron introduced me to his friends.  I was expecting that the gay community would feel somewhat like the Asian community—that feeling that there was common ground or some sort of bond.  But I didn’t feel like Aaron’s friends were interested in getting to know me.  It was kind of weird because when I went to Hyeji’s place the other day, her friends and her roommate from Hong Kong all openly talked to me.  It was weird that there was some sort of bond I didn’t feel with white people like I did with Asian people, even though I didn’t feel cultured as an Asian.  Asians were so much more open and willing to talk to me, but I wondered if that was only because I looked like an Asian.

I realized that being Asian was another Minority in the gay community.  Even just being an Asian man in general was a Minority when it came to dating life.  Being gay wasn’t something someone could see, but features characteristic to a person’s race definitely were.  Even during my freshman and sophomore years of college, I felt like people weren’t as open to me simply because I looked like an Asian.  Asians were considered to be an uglier race, and with the BYU dating culture, I saw that.  I guess that was why Asians tended to hang out with other Asians.  Even I didn’t find many of my own kind to initially be physically attractive.  But to exclude a race to the point that they weren’t worth associating with because they weren’t considered dating material?  That was so toxic and racist.

<u>I found it ironic that the gay community tried to inform people that sexual orientation wasn’t a choice and then chose to marginalize people in their own community merely because of their race—another factor that wasn’t a choice for people.</u>  The gay community and even society in general idealized a tall, fit, white guy as the paragon of "pretty."  Asian men were typically not that tall, had naturally slim body structure, and were obviously not white.  The Minority of the gay community and the marginalization of Asian men within that community was a similar pattern to how the LDS community was a Minority in society, yet when they made up the Majority like at BYU, they marginalized groups like the LGBTQ community.  It was a never-ending pattern of economic advantage.

“Yeah, they’re still privileged white people,” Gyuna said when I told her about my time with Aaron and his friends.

“I feel like my dating life has become so stagnant,” I said.  I had also gone on several other dates.  They were just one-time dates though.  “I don’t think I’m a romantic person.”

“You just gotta flirt, Michael.”

At this point, I felt like flirting was so fake.  I even grew skeptical when guys flirted over text or on the first date because I wondered if they said or did the same things with every guy, especially since things usually didn’t progress past a first date.  Even when I went on my date with Kent, I sure felt excited before the date, but during the date, it felt very matter of fact.  Now I was confused.  What was romance supposed to feel like on a date?

I also texted Connor again how he was doing.  He and I texted a few lines, but I felt like if I wasn’t going to meet him in person, texting him seemed useless.  He was just this mysterious, online person to me.  I also noticed that he had deleted his Hinge profile, so it seemed like he wasn’t interested in dating.  I decided to let go of him too since there wasn’t any sign of progress that he’d want to see me.

Or so I thought.  <u>He’s definitely got a story in the remaining chapters.</u>

## Section 4

December 20, 2022.  All of my roommates were out of the apartment at this point.  I was the only one left.  Gyuna and Christian were on vacation down in Arizona where Christian’s family lived, so I wasn’t going to have them around for most of the break.  I also knew that Shari was expecting her baby sometime soon, so I kept that in mind.

I had messaged a guy named <span style="color:red">Sam</span> for a week or two. 
I asked if he and I could meet in person, and he said we could after finals.  He was a BYU student studying mechanical engineering.  He was a pretty dry texter, so I didn’t expect much from the date.  Plus, I was just the usual skeptical me with how my dates had been going for the past month.  We planned to go to Black Bear Diner and then play some games at his place.

I drove to his place and texted him when I got there.  A few seconds later, I saw a guy walking towards my car.  Initially, I didn’t think it was him because he was REALLY cute!  But he waved at me and hopped in the car.  Dang, he sure was good-looking in person.

“Hey!” I greeted.  “Sam, right?”

“Yeah, Michael?” he greeted.

“Yeah!  Nice to meet you.”  I drove us to Black Bear Diner.  “I’d heard about language residence, but I didn’t know it was here.  Do you know a second language?”

“Yeah, I know Korean.”

“Oh, really?  Where did you learn Korean?”

“I served my mission in Korea.”

“That’s cool!  Hangugeo jogeum hal su isseoyo (I can speak a bit of Korean.).”

He spoke some Korean, but I wasn’t entirely sure if I was understanding him correctly.  “How do you know Korean?” he then asked.

“I served in a Korean branch on my mission in Seattle.  I was called English-speaking, so I didn’t expect to learn Korean.  But I’m glad I got to learn a bit.”

Sam and I talked for a bit.  Anytime I asked him a question, he’d smile really big.  Frick, he was SO cute!

“Would you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert?” I asked when we sat down at the restaurant.

“Definitely an introvert,” Sam answered.  “I’d consider myself an introvert with social anxiety.  I do prefer being in a bigger city though, somewhere outside of Utah.”

“I’d say I’m more introverted, but I do like getting to know new people, at least people who want to get to know me.  That was obviously not so on the mission.  I’m definitely pretty quiet in group settings, but I like having people around me.  I do like the city vibe, except I wish it were less expensive and safer.”

I learned that he grew up in Colorado and that he was going back home at the end of the week for Christmas.  He also liked learning, so school was his thing.  On top of a mechanical engineering degree, he was also doing a CS minor.  That sounded like a nightmare to me.

When we finished eating, we got back to his place and played some games.  “Do your roommates know Korean too?” I asked.

“Yeah,” Sam answered.  “We’re supposed to speak it all the time, but I’d say it’s like 50 percent of the time that we do.”

“It sounds like you know Korean pretty well then.”

I also asked about his dating life.  “How long have you been dating guys?”

“It’s been about a couple months.”

“Oh cool, I’ve been dating about that long too.  What got you into dating guys?”

“I think I’m still trying to figure that out.  I was in a relationship with a couple girls, but I didn’t feel anything.”

“I’ve never been in a relationship with girls or guys, but that’s the goal, being in a relationship with a guy.”  I told him my story.  “How has dating been for you?”

“It’s been okay.  Some good experiences, others okay.  I haven’t come out to too many people.  When I told my parents, it sounded like they didn’t believe me, so I was like, ‘Okay.’  They’ve been asking me a lot if I’ve been going on dates.  What about you?  How has dating been?”

“It’s been a roller coaster of emotions.  But it’s been a good experience overall.  I’ve only come out to my best friend.  She’s actually Korean.  But I haven’t told my family or anyone else.  I’ve thought a lot about coming out to my family, but it hasn’t felt right yet.  What do you think your parents would say or do if you told them that you were in a relationship with a guy?”

“I think on the outside, they’d try to be okay with it.  But on the inside, I know that they’d definitely not like it.”

After playing a few games, we decided to watch a movie.  “Have you heard of Studio Ghibli?” I asked.  “Like _Totoro_ or _Spirited Away_?”

“I don’t think so,” Sam answered.

“Studio Ghibli is basically the Disney of Japan.  Maybe we can watch _Spirited Away_.”  That was when I learned that Netflix didn’t have any of the classic Studio Ghibli movies.  “Well, I guess that kinda shows I’ve never had a Netflix account.”

“Do you like comedy?  Action?  Horror?”  Sam spent about five minutes scrolling through different movies.

“Probably not horror.  I don’t like scary or violent stuff.  I’ll let you choose,” I said as I tapped his knee.

During the movie he chose, Sam occasionally asked me questions.  I had such a hard time focusing on the movie though.  He was literally right beside me!

I noticed that his hand was inching closer and closer to my leg very slowly.  Then he lightly laid his pinky on my thigh, then his ring finger, his middle finger, his pointer finger, his thumb, and then his whole hand after about ten minutes.  My heart raced.

“You’re really cute,” I said.  I couldn’t believe I had the guts to tell him that.  I laid my head on his shoulder, and he laid his head on mine.

After about five minutes, Sam leaned in for a kiss.  And we basically made out for almost the rest of the movie.  I remembered when Gyuna told me that I wouldn’t see a thing if I watched a movie on a date.  Now I understood what she meant.

By the time my eyes were back on the TV screen, I had no idea what was going on in the movie.  I guess I couldn’t say I watched whatever movie we were watching.  (I obviously don’t remember what we “watched.”)

“Well.  It was nice meeting you,” Sam said as I got ready to head out.

I laughed.  “Nice meeting you too,” I said.  “You said you’ll be back before New Year’s, right?  Hopefully we’ll see each other again!”

Well, I really wanted to see Sam again soon!  I asked him if he’d be available before he’d leave, and we met again later in the week.  We ate out and then went to see some Christmas lights at the same place that Trevor and I met.

“What would you say are qualities you look for in a guy?” I asked.

“Someone who’s ambitious,” Sam answered.

That was an interesting quality.  “What do you mean by ambitious?”

“Someone who has goals and wants to reach somewhere high in life, like wanting to be the CEO of a company or something like that.  I think someone who has the same morals as me is important.  I also like people who can have deep, intelligent conversations—things like what the purpose of life is.”

I thought that was interesting.  He sounded like Peter.  “The purpose of life, like the plan of salvation?  Is that what you mean?”

“Kind of.  I’d say that my faith has been more or less not there.  I’ve had a lot on my mind about the Church.”

“Do you believe that what you taught on your mission was true?”

“Yeah, I’d say.”

“I try to remember those experiences when faith is tough, especially in the kind of circumstance we’re in.  What were your relationships like with the girls you dated?”

“They were okay,” Sam answered.  “I think it’s good that you haven’t been in a relationship.”

“What makes you say that?”

“Just a lot of time and effort.  And it’s hard to find someone who’s right for you.”

“Would you say that you’re looking for a long-term relationship?”

“I wouldn’t mind that.  But I wouldn’t mind being single for the rest of my life.”

We went to see the Christmas lights and walked around the shops there.  We then played some board games and card games at his place.  We also tried watching another movie.  This time, we held hands, and I knew it was game over for me.  I just wanted to kiss him!  So we made out, and I didn’t know what was going on when I saw the TV screen again.

Sam walked me out this time when I left.  “Have fun with your family!” I said.

“You too,” he said.

I gave him a one-arm hug.  I guess he wasn’t the most comfortable with it since he looked around as if someone could’ve been watching us.  But I hoped to see him again after his vacation.

## Section 5

December 21, 2022.  Kiyoshi Svend Jorgensen was born.  I was an uncle now!  I didn’t know what that meant, but it felt like having a younger sibling that I never had.

Nozomu and Deanna flew into Utah on Christmas Eve, and Mom flew in a few days later.  It sounded like Mom had to fill out some paperwork to get permission to leave the mission, but she was able to make it.  When we were all together, that was the first time I saw my nephew in person.

“You have to get up close so he can see you,” Shari said as she held Kiyoshi.  “His eyes are still developing.  After some time, he’ll be able to see a bit farther, and then he’ll begin to see color.  Babies usually see the color red first.”  It made sense.

Initially, I was a bit intimidated holding such a small human being.  Nozomu seemed to enjoy himself.  I didn’t find it quite as enjoyable; Kiyoshi didn’t do anything but sleep and eat and cry and poop.

“I felt the same way when my niece was born,” Deanna said.  She was also the youngest in her family.  “Give him a year or two, and he’ll be more interactive.  You can make him your minion.”  She continued.  “Have you tried your cookies ‘n cream milk?”

“I haven’t,” I answered.  I almost forgot that was still a thing.

“Maybe we can try one of these days.”

One day, Nozomu and Deanna invited me to spend time with them where they were staying.  They suggested that I buy cookies ‘n cream milk, but they were out of stock.

Mom did a lot of shopping for Shari and David.  Before she came to Utah, she asked if she could have the minivan, which was totally fine with me since it was her car.  But she never took the car with her.  I knew that she was going to be in Utah for only a week and a half, so I wanted to spend time with her.  She and I went shopping together for the most part.

One day, she asked me what my roommates were like.  My roommates and I still didn’t talk to each other that much, so I didn’t know anything about their lives.  “I learned that one of my roommates got engaged, but he never told me,” I continued.  “The only reason why I know is because there was a Facebook post about it.”

“Really?” Mom exclaimed.  “Something’s wrong.  How can you not know something like that about your roommate?”

“We just don’t talk to each other.”

“Have you tried talking to them?”

“Yeah.  But I’ve decided to move on and spend time with people who want to be friends with me and talk to me.”

“Maybe you can move into a different apartment.”

I shrugged.  “I don’t think it matters.  It’s different people but same pattern.”

“What makes you think that?”

“That’s kind of how it’s been since I’ve been at BYU.  I think it’s because I look different from other people.”

“Do you feel discriminated?”

“Kind of.  I feel like because I’m Japanese, people think I’m different.  And the dating culture doesn’t help.”

“But you’re not Japanese.  You’re definitely American.  You’re like a banana: yellow on the outside and white on the inside.”

I shrugged again.  “I still look like an Asian.”

“I know what it’s like to be discriminated.  But you should try to talk to people.  And if you do, then people will do the same.  If you help others, then they’ll help you back.”

I never understood that.  When I initiated social things, I rarely ever felt reciprocation.  I guess that was why I rarely initiated things.  I usually felt closer to those who initiated first.  That included people like Gyuna and Paige during my time at BYU.  Even with dating, I was usually the one to ask about meeting in person, but not much would happen after that first date.

Soon after that conversation, I was helping David change a lightbulb in the bathroom.  “I overheard your conversation with your mom,” he said.  “I just want to say that I think you’re great the way you are.”

I was surprised to hear that.  “Thanks,” I said.  He and I rarely ever talked to each other.

“In some ways, I can relate.  I feel a bit ostracized in my ward.”  He vaguely talked about how he had different perspectives from other people in the ward.  He wasn’t very specific, so for all I knew, he could’ve had a psychotic perspective about something, though I didn’t think that justified being ostracized.

I could overhear Mom talking to Shari about the conversation in the kitchen.  “I feel that I should apologize on behalf of our mother,” Shari told me when Mom went into her room for a mission meeting.  “I’ve had to listen to many lectures from her.”

“Same,” I said.

“I know she cares about us, but I think she just has some very different perspectives from us.”

It must have been nice that Mom felt reciprocation from people when she initiated things.

## Section 6

December 31, 2022.  While Sam was with his family, he and I occasionally texted each other.  He was still quite a dry texter, but it was okay.  At least he responded.  I was still skeptical that he’d ghost me though.

```Sam: You seem really worried about me ghosting you```

```But we should definitely at least hang```

By this time, he was back in Provo, so I asked if he was doing anything for New Year’s Eve.  He said he was pretty open, so we planned on going to Itto Sushi.  When I picked up Nozomu and Deanna, the three of us ate there for lunch, and I thought it was pretty good.  The two of them were back in Connecticut at this point.

It was hard to believe that I was going on a third date.  I had never been on a third date with the same guy.  I wondered when things would feel right before deciding to get serious.  I guess that was where communication was important.

“I should introduce you to my friend,” I said when Sam and I were at Itto Sushi.  “Her name is Gyuna Bak.  She and I served in Seattle together, and she transferred here just this past semester.  She’s been a good friend to me.”

“Yeah, I’d be fine with that,” Sam said.

“She’s on vacation right now, but you can meet her at the beginning of next semester for sure.”

After Itto Sushi, we went to Walmart to buy ice cream, pie, and a Martinelli to celebrate the new year.

Shari and David were nice enough to arrange Christmas stockings, and I got a game called Dos.  Sam and I played it together and then ate our desserts.

“Do you want the rest of the pie?” I asked.  “I know that if I keep it, I’m going to eat all of it and get fat.”

“You can have it,” Sam answered.  “Nothing wrong with getting fat.  You can share with your roommates.”

“I don’t think that’s gonna happen.”

We also watched _Spirited Away_.  I really wanted to kiss him, but I also wanted to watch the movie.

“Do you want to watch the movie?” Sam asked as I laid my head against his in the middle of the movie.

I laughed.  “Yeah,” I answered.

“I can sit on the other side of the couch if that’ll help.”

“Yeah, it’ll help, but I don’t want that.”

We actually watched the movie all the way through!  I kind of felt bad though.  I felt so disrespectful not watching the movies Sam wanted to show me, and here he was watching the one movie I wanted to show him.  But we made out again after the movie.

“So…  I’ll be honest, I’ve never gone past a second date with anyone,” I said.  “You’re the first.  I know we’ve seen each other in person for only a week and a half, but when’s the right time to define our relationship?”

“I’m definitely slower when it comes to knowing if I want to be in a relationship,” Sam answered.  “But if I go past a second date, I’m definitely more interested.”

“Gotcha.  Hopefully we can continue to get to know each other better.  I mean, so far, I like you.”

“I like you too.”

When it turned midnight, Sam and I said happy new year and gave each other another kiss.  Even when I was dropping him off at his place, we gave each other a goodnight kiss too.

...

The next day, I woke up to see something purple on my neck.  It looked like a bruise, but at least it didn’t hurt when I touched it.  And then I realized…

```Me: Is this what a hickey is?```

I sent a picture of my neck to Gyuna.

```Gyuna: I screenshot it```

```CAPITAL HIMMMMMM OH MY HOSH WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOOWOWOW```

```YOU GOT A FREAKING HICKEYSSSSSSSSS```

```Me: Dang, I better cover those up for church lol```

A few days later when Mom and I were shopping, she noticed it.  “What happened to your neck?” she asked.  “It’s purple.”

“I think I bumped my neck on something,” I said casually.  That was literally what I thought for a few hours before I suspected it was a hickey.  I didn’t even know those were a thing until Gyuna told me about them.

I really did want to be in a long-term relationship.  But now that things were starting to look that way, the skeptical side of me was definitely voicing its opinions.

```Me: I’m kinda scared now that it might actually end up being a thing.```

```Gyuna: Oh why u scared```

```?```

```Me: I guess I’m just scared that things might not work out.```

```And I wonder what’d happen afterwards.```

```Gyuna: Break uppppp```

```Or get married```

```Or date for a long time```

```It’s either one of these three```

```Me: Lol yeah. A break up will prolly happen.```

```Gyuna: Then why do u think it’s gonna work out```

```Me: Well. That’s the thing. I know I have to take a risk. But it’s scary.```

```I talked to him about it, and he said he could see us being friends.```

```But Kent said that we could be friends, but that didn’t happen.```

```Gyuna: He said he can see you being friends?```

```Me: Yeah if we did happen to be in a long-term relationship but it didn’t end up working out```

```So I’ve been on three dates with him so far, and on the second date was when I asked about relationships. He was like, It’s good that you haven’t been in a relationship. Which kinda made me think that he wasn’t interested in a relationship. But he told me that he’s pretty open to a long term relationship or living single or being married or being in a casual relationship. So… idk.```

```Also, the second time I went on a date with him, I was at his place, and I gave him a one arm hug, and he seemed kinda wary as if he felt someone was watching. But then when I dropped him off, we kissed. So… I’m just not sure if I should go forward or not lol.```

```Maybe I just need to go on more dates.```

```Gyuna: Jeez```

```You are so wild bro```

```Me: I’ve honestly been thinking a lot about coming out to Christian. I’m glad that you respect my story, but I feel bad that you have to lie to him about my feelings. Plus if Sam wants to do stuff with us, then it’ll definitely be difficult to maintain a good relationship.```

```Gyuna: That’s up to you Michael! We’d def so so so so so down to go double date with you like so badly but like your feelings come first to come out to Christian. It’s okay for me to give him limited information and that’s totally fine with him. You come first!```

```Me: Ok. Lol, it’ll just be so awkward. But it’ll happen at some point.```

```Gyuna: I do guarantee Christian being not judgy or anything hurtful to you for sure.```

```Me: Lol I guess I’ll have to see how Sam feels. But he’s given a few signs that he still wants to do stuff with me.```

```I guess I’ve just been more skeptical about people’s feelings and trusting that what they say about how they feel is really how they feel.```

…

Even though I had gone on a few dates with Sam, I was still trying to talk to other people on dating apps.  It sounded like Sam was doing the same thing.  I had been texting another guy named <span style="color:red">Mason</span> for a couple weeks, and he and I decided to get lunch at an Asian restaurant downtown.

Personality-wise, Mason was almost the complete opposite of Sam.  I could tell that Mason loved talking to people and got his energy that way.  He was probably the most extroverted person I went on a date with.  “One of my friends and I are going on a trip to San Francisco during MLK weekend,” he said.  “It’s pretty spontaneous, but it’s going to be short.  Plus, we found really cheap tickets, so we’re taking our chances.  You can go with us if you want.”

I had never been to California, but it was probably a bit too spontaneous for me to go on a trip with someone I barely met.  It probably would’ve cost a bit of money too.  “I’m more of a planner,” I said.  “If I don’t have things written down in my calendar, I forget.  Or I just feel unproductive.”

As we continued to talk, I learned that Mason was a member of the bishopric in his ward.  I was a bit surprised, but at the same time, it seemed fitting for how much of a people-person he was.  “It’s interesting being in the position that I am, but the whole ward has been very supportive of my decisions, including the other members of the bishopric,” he said.  “My parents are pretty involved in the Church, and a lot of people in the area know them.”  He lived in northern Utah.

We also talked about movies and TV shows.  He listed a bunch of shows I had never heard of.  “Maybe we can watch something together,” he suggested.

“That’d be cool,” I said.  “I feel like I’d get bored if I watched movies and shows by myself.”

Mason was a really nice guy and reminded me of Gyuna.  I didn’t feel much of a romantic connection like I did with Sam though.  I texted Mason thank you for the date and let him know that I may or may not get serious with someone else.  I was still down to watch movies and TV shows though, and I still wanted to make friends in the gay community.

...

January 5, 2023.  By this time, Mom had flown back to Guam.

Sam and I went on one more date before the semester began.  He and I planned on going on a hike up Rock Canyon.

“I brought a water bottle for you,” I said as we were heading out.

“I’m okay,” Sam said.

“You’re not going to drink water?”

“It’s a short hike, only like two or three hours.”

“Oh.  Well, if you end up fainting, I’m gonna laugh at you.  Actually, probably not.  I’d probably panic.”

After the hike, I told Sam about how Deanna wanted me to try BYU’s cookies ‘n cream milk.  “The Wilk and the Creamery were all out of stock,” I said.

“I know the vending machines have them,” Sam said.  He looked up places on his phone.  It looked like there was a vending machine at the Wilk, so we walked there.

No one could go wrong with cookies ‘n cream anything, but a water bottle-sized drink that costed $2.25…  “It tastes good,” I said.  “I don’t think it’s to die for though.”

“I could buy chocolate milk at Walmart for much cheaper, and it basically tastes the same,” Sam said.  “At least you can tell your sister-in-law that you finally tried cookies ‘n cream milk.”

Afterwards, we took the Myers-Briggs personality test together.  Sam said he had taken it a few times and that he always got INTJ.  That was what he got this time around as well, and I was ISFJ like last time.  We each read the personality descriptions.  The “romantic relationships” section stated that INTJs were pretty difficult when it came to romance.

“Do you agree with that?” I asked.

“Oh yeah,” Sam answered.  “I don’t think I’d be an easy person to date.”

“What would you say are qualities you’re trying to find in a guy?”

“I know I mentioned this before, but a dealbreaker for me is someone who’s ambitious.  I definitely want someone like that—someone who’s passionate about something and has goals and wants to make it to the top.  I also value someone who can carry intellectual conversations.  Also someone who is able to be independent.  But dating isn’t easy.  It’s hard to find someone who physically and emotionally and intellectually aligns.”

“Yeah.  Dating is hard.  During the first month of dating, dating was my top priority.  I just wanted to go on as many dates with as many guys as I could so I could figure out what qualities were important to me.  But now I've realized how difficult finding a long-term relationship can be.  Now I'm kinda like, ‘Meh.’  Sometimes it feels pointless and a waste of time to text a guy, go on one date, and then never see him again after that, even if we leave on good terms.  I mean, I still want to date, but sometimes it feels like I won’t ever find the right person."

"I can see us being at least friends," Sam said.  "It could be more."

"I mean, I do think about you from time to time.  And I always look forward to seeing you.  I remember that our first date was on Tuesday, and then our second date was on Friday, and I thought, ‘I just want it to be Friday!’  I mean, I really like you."

"I looked forward to today.  And I like you too."

“I guess I am a bit nervous about getting into a relationship.  I’ve never been in one before, girl or guy.  It’s completely new territory for me.  I’m not sure what I’m going to get myself into, but it’s ultimately what I want.  Like, if we were to get into a relationship and things didn’t work out, where would you see us?  Do you think we’d still talk or hang out?”

“I think so.  I’d say we could still be friends.”

“If people were to ask us how we knew each other, how would we talk about it?”

We thought for a bit.  It was honestly a bit sad that we had to make up a story for our own safety.  A straight couple could easily say that they were dating and had met wherever.  “I did take STAT 201 a few semesters ago,” Sam said.  “We could say that we knew each other at the stats lab.”

“Yeah, I guess that could work.  And we’d just say that we’re friends, right?”

“Right.  So...”  Sam paused for a bit.  “I'm not sure if I've told you about where I stand with my faith.  Basically, ever since I chose to date guys, my faith has been non-existent.  And at least for me, I think it’s important that I find someone who has the same morals as me.”

I didn’t understand what he meant by that.  I knew he talked about how his faith wasn’t always there, but he also talked about going to church on Sundays.  I guess he and I hadn’t talked much about the gospel and where we stood in regard to our sexuality.

Sam and I had spent quite a long time together.  He said he didn’t want to spend too long on a date, which I could understand why.  It was a bit exhausting.  Plus, he had work at 2 or 3 in the morning.  I dropped him off, and we kissed each other goodnight.

However, <u>I began to feel unsettled about what Sam had told me about his faith.  Non-existent...</u>

## Section 7

January 7, 2023.  Gyuna asked me if I could pick her and Christian up at the airport, so that was what I planned on doing tonight.

“Do you remember the day that you came out to me?” Gyuna asked during a conversation she and I had a couple weeks before.  “After you left, I called Christian, and I was like, ‘Michael and I had a really good talk.’  And he was like, ‘What, did he come out?’  And that completely threw me off, so I was like, ‘No!’ and accused him of thinking that.  But I feel like he already knows.”

“Really?  Since when?” I asked.

“When he first met you at the mission reunion.”

“Is there something about me that made him think that?  Like, my mannerisms?”

“Yeah.  Mostly the way you talk and your gestures.  Christian has a pretty good gay-dar.”  I learned that “gay-dar” was a term for how well someone could figure out if another person was gay.  I just assumed all guys were straight unless they said otherwise.  Sometimes straight guys did gay things.

While Gyuna and Christian were at the airport, I texted Gyuna telling her that I might come out to Christian.  She was pretty on-board with it.  I did feel like it would be good to come out to him, but I was so nervous thinking about it.  I also told her that I felt impressed to come out to my family by writing a reflection and sending it over the summer.

I was pretty behind on writing.  I had written up about half of the content for Parts 1 and 2, and I didn’t spend time writing during winter semester.  But I sent Gyuna a draft of Part 2, Chapter 2, to see what she thought.

I did feel impressions to send a reflection to my family.  Maybe it was a weird way of coming out, but I felt like there was so much to say without knowing how to say it in the moment.  Writing was a great way of retaining those “in-the-moment” words.

...

After a few hours, I picked up Gyuna and Christian at the Provo airport, and we stopped by Gyuna’s place for a bit.  I was still so nervous about coming out to Christian.  Maybe it wasn’t a good time to do it.

"How's Sam?" Gyuna asked randomly.  "Are you going to see him soon?”

Shoot.  I guess she was trying to help me muster some courage, but I felt a bit uncomfortable.  "I might see him on Sunday," I answered.

"Who's Sam?  How do you know him?" Christian asked.

"Uh... I know him from class," I answered, trying to practice what I'd say to someone if Sam and I were together.

"Yeah, and he served his mission in Korea," Gyuna added.

The subject changed, but Christian went back to Sam.  "Okay, so tell me more about Sam.  How long have you known him?"

"Uh... for a few weeks,” I answered.

"Do you keep in touch a lot?"

"I mean, yeah.  He's not the greatest at texting though."

“Oh, he's a really bad texter," Gyuna added.  She made some noodles to eat, so Christian went to grab some.  "Shaberu (Say it!)!" Gyuna whispered to me.

After a bit, we talked about Hyeji and how she was doing.  Christian had never met her, but he acted as if I had a romantic interest in her.  "Hey, look at that," he said.  He noticed my hickey.

"Yep!" I exclaimed.

Christian then turned to Gyuna.  "Wait..." he said.  Gyuna was just laughing the entire time.

"Guess who did it," I said.

"I don't know."  He pointed at Gyuna.  She and I shook our heads.  "Hyeji?"

"No."

"I don't know.  How would I know?  Sam?"

Gyuna and I both nodded.  "Yep!"

Christian's mouth dropped for about five seconds.  "Wait, is Sam a guy or a girl?"

"Sam’s a guy," I said.

"Okay, Sam HAS to be a code name for something."  Christian looked like he wasn’t having it as if Gyuna and I were playing a trick on him.

Gyuna laughed.  "I can't believe this is your reaction."

"Guys, you're teasing me," Christian said.

"No, we're not!" Gyuna and I exclaimed.  "Ask him more questions," Gyuna said to Christian.

"So... a guy kissed you and gave you a hickey?"

"Yeah,” I answered.  “I like guys."

"No.  You're playing me."

"I'm not.  Gyuna has known for a couple months.”

Gyuna laughed.  I was really surprised how surprised Christian was.  I felt like she would've somehow given hints to him considering how much I texted her about my dates.  "Remember that time when I said that Michael and I had a really good conversation?” she asked.  “And then you asked if Michael had come out to me?  I had to act like it wasn't true because I had to keep it a secret.  Or remember the times when I'd ask you questions about my Korean friend being shy and wanting to find dates?  I'd ask for advice so that I could give it to Michael."

"Wow, my mind is kind of blown.  Dang, it must be hard to have to go through those feelings.  I'm sorry."  I knew he was saying that not out of pity that I couldn't change my feelings but because I had to learn how to adapt to my circumstances with society.

"It's okay," I said.

"So how long have you known?"

"I've known since I was really young, before I was a teenager.  But all this time, I've suppressed my feelings and would try to live in self-denial.  Even for the past few years, I thought that these feelings of romance were evil, even for heterosexual couples.  If I were to do something romantic with a guy and it was considered a sin, how could a straight guy doing something romantic with a girl not be a sin?  The emotions themselves appear to be the same.  I used to think that marriage was just a ceremony and that it should've been completely independent of people's feelings.  But I've learned from dating guys that these emotions are good and completely natural.  The advice that Gyuna has given me seems to be relatable for both straight and gay people."

After some discussion, Gyuna said, "Remember that time when you and I were at the library for a really long time during the last week of the semester?  I asked a lot of questions pertaining to exaltation to Christian to see what his thoughts were."

"We're taught that God loves all His children,” Christian said.  “If He were to create a certain race or sexual orientation or gender that was inferior to another, then God would cease to be God.  He has to have some sort of plan for those in your situation."

"That's the thing that I don't really understand yet,” I said.  “It seems like the plan of salvation that we taught it as missionaries is advantageous to straight people.  Of course it's easy for straight people to say that it's for everyone because it's natural for them to find a romantic interest and love for someone of the opposite gender.  But one of the biggest things I've learned on the mission is that keeping the commandments isn't just about merely doing them.  It's definitely a starting point.  But you have to feel it too.  It has to be a desire from the core.  I mean, a sealing is merely a ceremony.  Anyone can mechanically go through the motions of a sealing as long as it's between a man and a woman, right?  But marriage is so much deeper than a ceremony.  That's what I've found out from dating guys.  I've never been romantically interested in dating girls.  I didn't even know what it meant to be 'romantically interested' until I started dating guys."

"Hey, I think it's really good that you've decided to explore this side of you,” Christian said.  “If you hadn't had a knowledge of what romantic love was, life would be pretty hollow.”

 "I think it's just frustrating that there aren't answers for people in my situation.  I don't think the prophets have really tried to empathize with our situation.  They talk ABOUT us.  But they rarely ever talk TO us.  And that's why I can empathize with gay members who leave the Church because what's the point of following the gospel and having a hope in the plan of salvation if exaltation isn't achievable for us, even if we mechanically marry a woman?"

I also talked to them about my dates with Sam.  "The thing that I'm scared of is that he told me that ever since he's been dating guys, his faith has been non-existent.  And I think it's sad that people think that they have to choose between their faith and their sexuality and leave the other one behind."

"Well, you can talk to him about your expectations with faith and see what his expectations are,” Christian said.  “Then you can see if you want to pursue something or not."

"I know that's what I should do, but I'm scared that things won't work out.  And... I think I'd become heartbroken."

"Well, it'd be better if things didn't work out sooner than if you were to get in a relationship for a while and then break up later.  You might be heartbroken for only a month if you were to communicate stuff like this early on."

"Yeah.  I had my heart broken once, and it sucked."

"But you've gotten over Kent, right?" Gyuna asked.

“Who’s Kent?” Christian asked.

"That’s a whole other story,” I said.  “But I guess it’s true that I’ve gotten over him.  Those two weeks were THE hardest I had to go through that semester.  That, and then coming out to Gyuna was probably the second hardest thing for me to do."

"I think heartbreak is just a part of dating,” Christian said.  “Some people feel heartbroken for months or even years."

"That's crazy.  See, I just can't believe how oblivious I've been.  I can't believe that people have felt the way I had this past semester.  And also with this hickey thing.  My mom asked me what happened to my neck, and I casually told her that I might have bumped my neck against something."

"Yeah, she definitely knows what actually happened."

"But she didn't say anything or give me a look.  Not even my sister or brother-in-law said anything."

"I think it's more out of respect,” Gyuna said.  “But your sister and brother-in-law are so young!  Of course they know what a hickey is!  It sounds like your family isn't very expressive, but they definitely know.  I can't believe how clumsy you are!"

"I mean, if I were to see something like that on someone's neck, I would've been like, 'Oh, he has a bruise.'"

"Yeah, only you would," Gyuna and Christian said.

“But hey, I did read that part of your reflection that you sent me,” Gyuna said.  “You’re so good at writing!”

“I do feel like this is a way for me to share my story with my family," I said.  "I feel like telling my parents first would be the right way to do things, but I feel like they’d tell my whole family.  So I might as well be the one to share my story with everyone.  My family is my audience, so I’m keeping them in mind as I write it.”

After about an hour or two of talk, I went back to my apartment and texted Sam about successfully coming out to Christian.  I felt somewhat relieved.  Now I could do things with Sam if Christian were also around and not feel uncomfortable.  Winter semester was going to start in two days, and I hoped that I’d be able to introduce Sam to both of them soon.

But I was still somewhat unsettled about where we were as far as faith and sexuality.  I knew that I needed to figure that out before committing to a relationship.
