## Section 1

November 8, 2022.  “Hey, Michael!” Kent greeted.  He sounded as if I was one of his old friends, reuniting for the first time in a while.

“Hey!” I greeted nervously.  “Kent, right?”

“Yeah!” he exclaimed as he got up from his seat.  He gave me a hug.

Shoot.  I was NOT expecting that.  Even though it was probably just a friendly hug, I felt SO vulnerable being hugged by a guy in front of a bunch of people.  I also saw his friend.  Thankfully, I didn’t recognize her.

I settled in an empty seat next to Kent and tried my best to remain calm.  Thankfully, he made me feel comfortable talking to me and including me in conversations with his friend.

“You said you served in San Diego?” I asked Kent’s friend.

“Yeah,” she answered.

“Did you know an Hermana Frederich?”

“Actually, yeah!  She was my trainer!”

“What?!  No way!  I lived in the same stake as her in Kentucky.  She and I were really good friends in high school.”

“Wait, were you at her birthday party?” she asked.

“Yeah, I was!”

“Okay, I was there too!”

“You actually do look vaguely familiar.  That’s crazy.”

“Yes, Carli is so amazing!”

After about half an hour, Kent's friend left to go to a choir rehearsal.

“Thanks for being so flexible,” Kent said.  “I know it was probably awkward to have someone else there.  Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.  Also, sorry that I look like this.”  He stroked his chin and cheeks.  “I haven’t shaved in a while.”

“No worries,” I said.  “It’s good to get to know new people.”

“You were really nice to her.  Don’t think I was trying to judge or test you, but it’s something that I observe in people.  But how has school been?”

“Pretty busy, but it’s been good.  I’ve got a midterm coming up in one of my stat classes.”

“Oh yeah, you’re studying statistics.  You seem smart.”

“Thanks.  You said you want to become a doctor?”

“Yep!  I’m hoping to graduate in August next year and maybe do a year of work before I go to medical school.”

“You seem pretty smart too,” I said.  “I liked science in high school, but biology and chemistry classes here sound terrible.  I used to study at the LSB all the time, and I’d sometimes listen to people studying for their biology or chemistry test.”

“It’s a lot of studying for sure, but it’s not too bad.  Most biology and chemistry classes have a 75-percent weight on just tests, so if you don’t do well on a test, then it really affects your overall grade."  He continued.  “So what would you say is your type of humor?”

Type of humor?  I wasn’t sure if there was a category of things that made me laugh.  “I don’t know,” I answered.  I felt dumb.  It sounded like I didn’t laugh about anything.  “I’d say inside jokes.”

“What about memes?  Do you like memes?”

“Yeah, I like memes.”

“Okay, good, I LOVE memes.  I live off of them.”

“Would you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert?” I asked.

“I’ve become a bit more introverted.  In high school, I was more outgoing, but with the pandemic and stuff, I’ve definitely become more introverted.  What about you?”

“I’d say I’m more of an introvert, though I don’t like being by myself for too long.  I like studying where there are other people around me.  I’m definitely more of a one-on-one person, but I’m pretty quiet in group settings.”

“Yeah, I’m pretty quiet in groups too.  Family reunions can be crazy.  Sometimes I’ll just walk up and leave in the middle of it without saying bye if I’m not feeling it.”

“That’s actually so relatable.  I usually leave activities if I don’t find it to be a productive use of my time.”

Kent and I talked for about a couple hours.  I began to feel a lot more comfortable.  It actually felt natural to hold a conversation, and he kept it going, which I liked.  “So how long have you been out?” he asked, lowering his voice.

“I actually haven’t come out to anyone,” I answered, also lowering my voice.

“You haven’t come out to ANYONE?!”  He sounded so surprised.  “That must be so hard!”

I shrugged.  “I guess I won’t know how hard it will be until I tell someone.”

“I guess that’s true.  Have you ever thought about coming out to your family or to your friends?”

I actually wasn’t sure.  Coming out to someone wasn’t on my mind that much.  “I guess it kind of depends on if I really want to date guys.  You’re actually the first person I’ve met in person from dating apps.  If I have good experiences from meeting guys, I’ll continue, but if not, then I can just act like I don’t have these feelings at all.”

“Well, hopefully I don’t make you run away.  I can be a bit crazy sometimes.  But dang!  I can’t believe you haven’t told anyone!  It’s so interesting because at least with dating, I was in your shoes about a year ago.  I had come out to my parents as a teenager, but I still dated girls.  But after coming back from my mission, I sort of had a crisis.  I have lots of friends who are girls, but when I’d date girls, I just didn’t feel anything.  I don’t know how descriptive you want me to be, but I’d try to make out with girls, but I still didn’t feel anything.  Dating guys feels so much different from dating girls.”

“I still do have a lot of fears about dating guys.  I mean, it’s BYU, first of all.  But I’m also scared if I’m dating a guy that I’ll randomly come across someone I know.  It’s scary.”

“Yeah, I get that.  It is scary.  But I think you’ll find that you’ll receive a lot more support from people than you think.  I told my roommates that I was gay, and we all kind of laughed about it and moved on.  I also have a relative who used to talk about how ‘those gay liberals were always messing everything up,’ but when he found out that I was gay, he seems more respectful now and doesn’t say anything shallow like that, at least around me.  Also, when I told my mom that I made out with a guy for the first time, she was like, ‘Oh my gosh!  I lost my son!’  And I was like, ‘Mom.  I’m still here.’  Sometimes it takes a bit of explaining and understanding, but most people have been supportive.”

“What are you hoping to get from dating guys?” I asked.

“I definitely see myself getting married at some point.  I don’t want to remain celibate for the rest of my life.  I want to raise a family with kids.  What about you?”

I still found it difficult to find the words to express my feelings.  I had never talked or even written about what I had felt.  “I’m not entirely sure,” I answered.  “I think marrying a guy would be a possibility.  But… I don’t know.  I don’t know what I’d do about the Church or what my family would think.  Last school year, I didn’t really have any friends, so I thought I’d live to be single for the rest of my life.”

“Aww, that’s really sad!” Kent exclaimed.

“But one of my friends from the mission transferred to BYU-Provo this semester, and she’s been such a good friend to me.  I think I realized then that I can’t be alone for the rest of my life.”

“Do you hang out with your friend a lot?”

“Yeah, she and I hang out almost every day.  Her name is Gyuna.  She’s from Korea.  She and I usually try to study together, but we end up having really long conversations and get pretty distracted.”

“I think that’s typical.  I mean, if you’re around your friends, you’re bound to talk to them.  But she sounds like a good friend!  <u>She could possibly be someone you come out to.</u>”

Maybe she would be a good person to tell this about.  I wasn’t exactly sure what she’d help me with, but I knew that it would probably manifest itself at some point, especially if I was going to continue dating guys.

“Well, I’m going to get a drink of water,” Kent said after some more conversation.  “Do you want water too?”

“I think I’m good,” I replied.

“You’re probably like, ‘This guy talks way too much.’  I’ve probably distracted you from studying for your midterm, haven’t I?”

“Oh no, you’re good!  It’s good getting to know you in person.”

While Kent was gone, I checked my phone to see that I had gotten a reply from Connor.  I had asked him a couple days ago what his week looked like, and it sounded like he was going to be busy with a test and some projects.  I wasn’t sure if he was going to be available this week, but I asked him if he wanted to go on a date.  Maybe he was saying he was busy because he didn’t want to go on a date with me, but I hoped that at least he and I could be… friends or allies?  I wasn’t sure what the word was, but <u>I didn’t want to burn bridges with guys in our tiny pool.  I felt like a divide within the gay community would’ve been extremely detrimental, especially at BYU.</u>

```Connor: Michael, I think I am actually going to say no to a date. There’s a lot going on in my life and I think I need to focus on myself for a bit before I get back into dating. I hope you understand. You seem like a really great person so it’s nothing about you. Yes of course we can be friends. I know that beginning to come out to yourself and dating can be a lot so just know I’m here if you need someone to talk to.```

Well, it was a bit of a bummer.  But at least he was being honest.  Maybe that was why it took him a couple days to respond back to me.  I didn’t understand what he meant when he said he needed to focus on himself before getting back into dating, but maybe I’d walk that same path as well.  I had no right to judge.

```Me: Hey, thanks for being honest. I think honesty is super attractive ;) I hope that whatever’s happening in your life turns out to be the best for you!```

After a few minutes, Kent came back.  I had my STAT 330 notes out to study, but I had such a hard time focusing.  Even though I felt more comfortable talking to Kent, I still felt butterflies in my stomach.  It was so weird that I felt this way.

“So you said you’ve been dating guys for about a year,” I said.  “Have you ever been in a relationship?”

“I have with one guy,” Kent said.  “But it only lasted for three or four months.  Guys can sometimes be the worst.  He’s not a bad person, but as we got to know each other more, our personalities were pretty different.  Our relationship got kind of toxic.  I didn’t go on dates over the summer, and I guess I got sad, so that’s why I downloaded dating apps again.  Have you ever been in a relationship with any girls?”

“I haven’t,” I answered.  “I’ve never been interested in dating girls.  I went on ‘dates’ in high school.  Honestly, I don’t really even know what a date is or what it’s supposed to feel like, but ever since I’ve seen straight people in relationships here at BYU, it’s something I’ve never wanted.  Even thinking about holding a girl’s hand kinda disgusts me.  But I’ve always suppressed these feelings I’ve had for guys.  I can be pretty stoic, and I’d try not to express my feelings.  That was kind of how I was in high school.  I did a year at BYU before my mission, and I’d always make the excuse not to go on a date by saying that I was going on a mission.  I don’t think anyone was interested in going on a date with me anyway, which I guess was a good thing.  Thinking back, if I did have feelings for a guy, the way I’d try to suppress them was to live in denial of those feelings or to tell myself that I felt ‘good’ around them.  But I’ve learned that I can’t run away from my own shadow.  These feelings have always shown up from time to time, and I’ve never had those kinds of feelings for girls.  That’s been my reality.”

“Yeah, I think everyone tries to live in denial at some point.  It’s hard.  When I was in a relationship, my ex and I hadn’t come out to many of our friends, so we had to keep things pretty hidden.”

“Is he a BYU student?” I asked.

“Yeah.  He’s doing an internship in Washington DC right now though.”  He continued, “So tell me more about your friend Gyuna!  What do you like about her?  What kinds of stuff do you do together?”

“Well, we have a CS class together, so we usually work on the labs together.  She makes good food, so she’ll sometimes invite me over to have dinner with her.  On the weekends, she sometimes goes to Rexburg to meet her boyfriend, and he sometimes comes down here to Provo.  The three of us usually hang out over the weekends together.  I think she’s been a really good friend to me because she talks to me.  I don’t feel like a lot of people are like that to me.  I’d say my love language is when people talk to me, and she’s good at that.”

“When I get comfortable around people, I’m a very touchy person,” Kent said.  I thought about how Gyuna’s love language was physical touch as well.  But unlike how cringy I thought it was that Gyuna would touch me, I didn’t think I’d mind Kent being touchy.  He was really nice, he seemed smart, and I felt like I vibed with him.

Wait.  I felt like I wouldn’t mind if Kent was touchy?  Where did that feeling come from?

“But it really does sound like you and Gyuna are tight,” Kent continued.  “I think she’d be a great person to talk to.  And I’m here as well if you need to talk.  I know it can be hard.  It’s definitely a journey.”

Kent and I had been at the library for about four hours, at which point I needed to leave to attend a data science leadership meeting.  “Well, I think I’ll need to go,” I said.  “It’s a Zoom meeting, but I think I’ll chill in the Talmage since that’s where we usually meet.”

“No worries!  It was really nice to meet you!”

“Do you want to plan something to do later?”

“Sure!  I could do Friday night if you’re available.”

“Yeah, that sounds good.”

“I’ve got a movie that I need to watch for my Spanish class at the Kimball Tower.  It’s at 5.  So we could get something to eat at 6:30 if you want.  Or if you want to watch the movie with me, we can do that too.”

“I’d be down to watch the movie,” I said.

“Okay cool, let’s shoot for Friday at 5 then.”

I put it in my calendar.

“Well, it was nice to meet you, Michael,” Kent said.  He stood up and gave me another hug.  This time, I didn’t feel as stunned, so I actually gave him a hug back.

“Nice, to meet you too, Kent!”

As I headed over to the Talmage Building, I got a text from him:

```Kent: Super fun to meet you Michael! You’re way nice and I’m glad we got to study together.```

```Me: Good to meet you too Kent! Honestly kinda had butterflies the entire time, so it was hard to study lol. And I think you still look good even without shaving ;) I kinda felt awkward to say that in public lol```

```Kent: Haha, thanks man. You’re pretty cute yourself ;). Yeah, sorry I wasn’t studying very well either.```

I didn’t think he looked as cute as Connor, but as I got to know Kent and his personality, I really liked him!  And it sounded like he liked me as well!  Wow, I didn’t realize that my body could feel the way it did.  Talk about hormones.

...

I also had another date that evening.  His name was Chris, and he and I arranged to meet at a Thai restaurant in downtown Provo.  He said he was a high school history teacher and used to work at BYU.  He was also a bit older than me: 39 years old.  I knew that a huge age gap was looked down upon, but I felt like I needed to keep my options open as far as going on dates with guys.

Again, I was pretty nervous.  I said a prayer that I would be safe, and I headed out the door and took the bus.  Chris said he was already there and was waiting for me.

When I got to the restaurant, I noticed a guy waiting outside his car.  He and I made awkward eye contact.  “Chris?” I greeted.

“Yeah,” he said.

“Nice to meet you.  I’m Michael.”

He nodded.  He and I made our way to the restaurant.

It was a bit of an awkward conversation.  From the start, I definitely didn’t feel like I vibed with him like I did with Kent, but I got to know Chris a bit.  “I worked at BYU for a number of years and then became a high school history teacher,” he said.  “I was married to a woman, but I’m divorced now.”

“Do you have any children?” I asked.

“Yeah, I have three.  So you said you’re studying statistics at BYU?  It must be hard dating guys in that environment.  How long have you been dating?”

“I’ve only been on one date so far, so I’m still pretty new.”

“Have you come out to anyone?” he asked.

“I haven’t.”

“Not even to your family?  Or a friend?  Or your bishop?  You’re a member, right?”

“Yeah, I’m a member, but I haven’t told anyone.”

“Wow, that must be hard.”

“The first I guy I went on a date with said the same thing, but I guess I won’t know how hard this life is until I tell someone.”

“Well, it’s the beginning of a new journey for sure.  And it’ll be tough.  I can tell you that.”  He continued, “So how open are you when it comes to talking about the Church?”

“I’m an active member,” I answered.  I thought it was an odd question, but I realized that there were probably many gay people who didn’t like the Church.

Chris talked about the Family Proclamation and how people thought it was rather random and straightforward that marriage should be between a man and a woman and that children should be raised in a nurturing environment.  He told me that Hawaii had been talking about legalizing gay marriage around the time that the Family Proclamation was written.  It was something that the First Presidency wanted to address, as gay marriage was an extremely exotic and taboo thing in its time.  I guess it was an interesting… theory.  “I’ve talked to my bishop about my feelings,” Chris continued.  “I’ve pondered a lot about my feelings for guys and have prayed for answers about what I should do about them, and I feel like I’ve gotten an answer to pursue a relationship with a guy.  I think heterosexual couples have the same kinds of feelings for the opposite gender as the feelings that homosexual couples have for each other.  I asked my bishop why the Church doesn’t allow gay couples to be sealed in the temple, and he said he can’t do anything about that because the First Presidency says that sealings can only be between a man and a woman.  I just pray that the First Presidency will actually take time to think and to pray about people who are in similar situations as ours.”  He talked for about 20 minutes, at which point I had finished my food.  I saw that he barely touched his.

“Are you finished with your food?” I asked.  It looked like he was going to get up to pay.

“Yeah,” he answered.  “I mean, it was pretty good, but I guess all that talking didn’t make me hungry anymore.”

He and I planned on going to BYU’s Museum of Art, but it was closed by the time we got there.  Instead, we got apple pies from McDonald’s and ate in the parking lot.

“So do you think you’d tell your family sometime soon?” Chris asked.

“Maybe,” I answered.  “I do want to be in a long-term relationship with someone, and I definitely don’t want to try to hide that part of my life from them.  That would be extremely painful for me to do.”

“Why did you want to go on a date with me?  I mean, I’m considerably older than you.”

“I’m trying to be open with my options.  I want to date different guys to see what qualities I like.”

I could tell Chris was trying to hold back from saying something.  “I want to give you advice, but I know that it’s your life.  But if I were in your shoes, I’d tell your family.  Or tell at least someone you’re close to.  This kind of life is not easy to do by yourself.  I don’t know your parents, but at least being a parent of three kids, I’d hope your parents would still accept you.  These feelings have been with you, no matter if your parents had a knowledge of them or not.”

After some conversation, he dropped me off at my apartment.  I didn’t feel like I vibed with him, not like I did with Kent.  I definitely felt like Chris was in a different stage of his life.  It was probably why people pursued others who were closer in age.  I did get a text from Chris a couple weeks later that he was pursuing a relationship with someone else and that he wouldn’t text me again.  I didn’t feel like I would’ve wanted to pursue a relationship with him anyway, but I didn’t think it was thoughtful of him to just block me from his life.  Again, there weren’t many people in the gay community, and I felt like a united community was what would help bring understanding to others.

...

November 9, 2022.

```Kent: How’s your day?```

I was surprised to hear from Kent!  After meeting him yesterday and after my date with Chris, I realized that I really, really liked Kent!  Even last night, I only got four hours of sleep.

I woke up to a racing heart.  I was SO excited for my date with him on Friday!  I hadn’t felt so excited like this in a long time.  The last time I felt like this was when I got my driver’s license.  There was nothing romantic about getting a driver’s license though.

Wait.  Was this what people called “romantic feelings”?  I began to question my previous perceptions.  Maybe it wasn’t bad to have these kinds of emotions.  At least to me, they felt good!  It wasn’t just a feeling of excitement about something: it was a feeling of excitement about SOMEONE.  It was a feeling where I couldn’t stop thinking about that someone.  Even though I hung out with Gyuna almost every day, I didn’t feel anything like that with her.  Heck, I was kind of disgusted even thinking about viewing her like that.

For the first time in such a long time, I felt SO happy!  Even “happy” didn’t feel like the right word.  It was a weird feeling that I felt this way, but I felt so good inside!  It made me want to be a little kinder, a little more thoughtful.

In STAT 240, I had finished my second midterm.  I sat by a Korean named <span style="color:red">Hyeji</span> whom I first met at an actuary info session near the beginning of the semester.  She decided to sit by me since then.

“How did you do on the midterm?” she asked during class.

“I missed one question,” I answered.  “I’m really surprised.  It wasn’t an easy midterm.”

“Yeah, I think I did the worst on any midterm I’ve ever taken.  I missed ten questions.  Would you happen to have time outside of class to help me go over the questions I missed?  Maybe explain them so that I can understand?”

“Sure!”

Even right after class, she sometimes asked questions about concepts that were discussed.  If she and I were in the stats lab, she also sometimes asked me questions about homework.

The following day, she and I went to the fourth floor of the library and spent a couple hours going over her questions.  “Sorry I ask so many questions,” she said.  “I feel like I have to question every little thing and have things explained to me like a five-year-old.  You know, I feel kind of bad that I haven’t done much in return for all that you’ve helped me with.  What are you doing on Saturday?”

“I don’t have much going on that day,” I said.

“I have an actuarial exam, but hopefully I’ll finish around 3.  Maybe we can go somewhere to eat, and I’ll pay for your meal.  Have you been to Feast Buffet?”

“I haven’t.”

“It’s an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet, but they also have a Mongolian grill.”

“Maybe I can invite Gyuna, and you two can meet each other!”  I had told Hyeji about Gyuna, and Hyeji said she wanted to meet her.  So that was the plan.

## Section 2

As I started dating, many thoughts and questions filled my mind.

Many people in the Church—and I assumed people outside the Church as well—said that same-sex attraction and homosexuality were feelings of “unnatural affection,” that there was a cure to the same-sex Disease.  I knew that the Church taught that marriage between a man and a woman was ordained of God.  What I didn’t understand was why people—especially at BYU—made such a big deal about romance or having “feelings” for another person.  The ceremony of a marriage sealing was mechanical: take someone with XX sex chromosomes and another with XY sex chromosomes, and allow them to take that next steppingstone towards exaltation.  Of course, they weren’t guaranteed exaltation; they both had to keep their covenants together.  But why try to involve emotions?  I didn’t like it when people talked about how they FELT when they went on a date and why they made it such a big deal.  Wasn’t there a way to cure the Disease—these feelings of “romance,” whether the victims inflicted were straight or gay?

If anything felt like “unnatural affection” to me, it was the thought of trying to date and marry a girl whom I had "feelings" for.  The thought of even touching a girl felt perverted and offended my mind.  And maybe that was what straight guys thought about dating and marrying a guy.  I could now sort of understand why straight guys would say it was “unnatural affection” to be in a homosexual relationship, but what about gay guys being in a heterosexual relationship?  That definitely would’ve felt like “unnatural affection” to me.

Along with “unnatural affection,” another thing I heard from many members of the Church was that people can choose to be gay.  I didn’t understand that either.  Even though I had tried to suppress and even deny my feelings for guys the past 16 years, I didn’t make a conscious choice to have these feelings.  Did straight guys get to weigh the options of liking girls or liking guys and made a choice to like girls?  If that were the case, I was sure that almost 100 percent of “straight” guys chose to like girls.  I was pretty sure that straight guys didn’t choose their sexual orientation just as much as I didn’t get to choose mine.

Plus, from a logical perspective, life would’ve been much easier if I had been attracted to girls in the first place.  Straight people made up the Majority of society.  Men and women could have children of their own and not have to adopt.  And having an attraction towards the opposite sex allowed a natural flow towards exaltation.

<u>One of the greatest lessons I learned from my mission was that keeping the commandments and obeying mission rules didn’t mean merely going through the motions.  It also had to come from the heart.  It had to have desire behind the motions.</u>  Of course, going through the motions was a possible starting point, but it wasn’t enough.  That too must have applied with marriage.  Now I realized what Gyuna meant when she said she’d run away from Christian if he never touched her.  It wasn’t merely to satisfy her love language.  Physical touch was supposed to feel like a natural thing, just like she said.  Following the directions from a romantic-love manual by extending the arm where the phalanges of one person touched the clavicle of the other wasn’t how romance should’ve sounded or felt or looked like.  Romantic love wasn’t a mechanical matter.  I began to understand that with my feelings toward Kent.  Physical touch from Kent wasn’t something I thought I needed; it was something I WANTED.

However, I felt conflicted with my emotions and my logical mind.  My goal was to receive exaltation.  I felt like my family raised me well on gospel principles, and I felt like living the gospel shaped so much of my life.  I wanted to return to live with my Heavenly Father and to be with my family in the eternities.  That was why in high school, I thought I would marry a woman and raise a family.  But there were more implications about marriage than my innocent mind thought there were.  I didn’t understand why society made such a big deal about physical touch, but now I understood the question of how a couple could be happy if there was no desire for physical touch.  And how would that affect their posterity?  If I had natural inclinations towards guys and had no desire for a girl, how could I receive exaltation?  Now I understood that question from a non-mechanical perspective.  Even if I went through the motions, would that be enough?  No, not from the lessons I had learned from my mission.

I also knew some members of the Church theorized that in the spirit world, the “unnatural affections” would correct themselves—that everyone would be straight.  I didn’t understand that though.  Of course it would be easy for straight people to say that we’d all become straight because that was how they naturally felt all the time.  But the scriptures said that we would carry the desires of the heart with us after this life.  Weren’t romantic feelings one of the desires of the heart?  Sure, things like anxiety and depression would dissipate when we’d be resurrected.  I was looking forward to that.  But a complete change in my sexual orientation?  That just sounded wrong and perverted.  In a hypothetical situation, if God created man and woman such that men had children with men and women had children with women, would straight people feel hopeful that their sexual orientation would change in the spirit world so that they’d become gay?  I wouldn’t think so.  If people were mechanical, straight people would kill themselves so that they could feel gay.  Even that sounded ironic.  And sure, it was a hypothetical situation, but this kind of hypothetical situation was my reality.

When I tried to find ways to cure the Disease, I couldn’t find a real answer.  No methods were shown on the Church’s website, and the Internet said that meditating could help.  But it was only a temporary thing.  Those romantic feelings didn’t permanently go away.  I also read articles about the unethical practices of conversion therapy.  It was something that the Church didn’t support either.  Some of the practices of conversion therapy included electrocution, self-harm when romantic feelings arose, and even priests chanting a prayer or reading scripture.  Obviously, they were abusive methods, but I thought it was interesting that the Church didn’t support methods of changing one’s sexual orientation to becoming straight.

Growing up, I never understood why people said they would get angry with God.  But for the first time in my entire life, I felt UPSET at God.  I felt like the terrestrial and telestial kingdoms existed partly because there were people like me who existed, that I could never achieve the highest degree of the celestial kingdom.  The “plan of happiness” now seemed to be a “plan of happiness for straight people.”  Why did God allow something that would completely impede someone’s path to exaltation?  Marrying a woman wasn’t going to be enough.  And it wasn’t enough to say that the reason why I felt attraction towards guys was because “we need to experience sadness in order to understand what joy is” or that “there’s opposition in all things.”  It was easy for straight people to say that “attraction isn’t a sin” because they could act on their romantic feelings.  They could easily act on their desires to date and marry and have children.  But what if they applied that principle of not acting on romantic feelings to their own lives—basically living the life of a missionary where an elder couldn’t hold hands with a sister or ask her on a date?  There was no joy being stuck in a circumstance where others around me said things like, “It’s okay to feel the way you’re feeling.  You just can’t act on them.”  So then what was the point of having these feelings?  No matter how much I denied my feelings or prayed for them to go away or went on dates with girls, I couldn’t run away from my own shadow.  And it hurt doing those things.

From time to time, I felt absolute hopelessness.  My goal of receiving exaltation seemed like it wouldn’t be achievable.  If it was true that God wasn’t a respecter of persons when it came to receiving exaltation, then what plan was there for me?

## Section 3

```Me: Hope your day goes well too! So far, I’ve helped one of my classmates on test corrections from our STAT 240 midterm. She’s also Korean. She said she wants to treat me to lunch on Saturday, so I guess I’ve gained a friend lol. But bruh, ngl, I’m excited for tomorrow. I mean, I know I could probably see you again before then, but I’d probably get distracted cuz… you know… ;)```

Another day had passed, and I got four hours of sleep again the previous night.  I was the kind of person who needed his sleep to function properly, and I felt it.  I was SO excited though!  I couldn’t wait for my date with Kent!

```Kent: Hahah, I’m excited for tomorrow too. It’ll be fun to get to know you a bit more so hopefully we can both feel more comfortable around each other. And wow! You’re so kind to help your friends out! See, you’re dang smart. Also, I really hope the movie tomorrow isn’t super boring. Good thing it isn’t too long.```

During the past few days, I had been thinking a lot about coming out to Gyuna.  Maybe it would be a good idea because I was being pretty honest about my feelings to Kent, and I wasn’t sure how he felt.  It sounded like he liked me though!  But what if he and I got into a serious relationship?  I didn’t want to hide stuff from Gyuna, especially considering how much she and I hung out together.  I was really nervous.  Should I tell her?

...

November 11, 2022.

```Kent: well I’m glad you get to date and have fun haha, I think that’s important. I’m sorry you woke up earlier than desired, hopefully today is still a good day!!!```

```Me: Haha you don’t have to be sorry. I haven’t felt this way in a while. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I was about to get my driver’s license. But yeah, I hope I can feel more comfortable being around you and keep my hormones under control lol```

```Kent: Haha, I hope I can do the same and keep my hormones in check. One thing to know about me is I’m a very touchy person. Like seriously, when I get comfortable around people I get crazy. I just love hugs and cuddling```

```Me: Haha that’s enticing. I kinda used to feel reserved about touching others just so I wouldn’t give off the wrong impression. Lol Gyuna is a really touchy person. She likes to grab my elbow. She says that’s her way of expressing that she likes someone whether romantically or not. Haha I have to say, I did get thrown off a bit when you first hugged me. Definitely didn’t expect that. But now that I know… Would you show physical affection in public with guys? Or did you do it more privately?```

```Kent: I mean, I hug everyone regardless of gender. That’s how I express love to friends. But I mean, I would probably cuddle or hold hands with guys in a more private setting. Maybe if away from BYU, I’d hold hands or do a quick kiss in public if the other guy was comfortable with it.```

```Me: Gotcha. I’ve never kissed anyone, but I’d be curious with you, maybe more in a private setting though. Lol idk if it’s too soon to say such a thing.```

```I guess I’m still trying to figure things out.```

```Kent: I mean, I’m not opposed to that. We’ll see how things go haha. I love how kind you are, that makes me even more attracted to you```

```Me: Oo ok :)) *gets 50 millionth rush of hormones```

```My love language is when people are able to talk to me or have a conversation with me. I just feel loved and appreciated, I guess because there aren’t many people who are like that. I felt like we vibed well, and I hope it continues. Plus I think you’re really cute. Like, REALLY cute. Lol.```

```Kent: I agree, I thought we vibed really well, even though we didn’t get much studying done haha. Awwww thanks, you’re so sweet. You’re a cutie yourself```

...

Today was the day of the date!  Finally!  It felt like forever.  The plan was to watch the movie that Kent had invited me to at 5 and then to eat at Costa Vida, which wasn’t too far from campus.

Class for CS 180 got cancelled, so Gyuna invited me to her place to eat lunch.  “What do you plan on doing for the rest of the day?” she asked.

I got a bit nervous.  “Uh, I’ll be busy at 5, so I probably won’t be available tonight unless you plan on being on campus late.”

After I had lunch with Gyuna, I was in the stats lab until 4:45, at which point I knew that it was about time to get ready to go to the Kimball Tower.  I was SO.  FREAKING.  NERVOUS!  This whole time, I was so excited, but then I felt the adrenaline start kicking in.  Why was I feeling this way?!

I had to go to the bathroom to take another dump.  Just breathe in!  And breathe out!

I walked to the Kimball Tower and nervously waited inside.  After a few texts, Kent found me.  I just needed to relax.  It was time for another date.

...

“How was your day, Michael?” Kent greeted.

For some reason, I couldn’t think about what I had done today.  I was SO nervous.  “It was a pretty normal day,” I responded.  “Just classes and homework.  What about you?”

“Well, I went to work this morning and then did some homework.  Here’s the place where they show films.”  He opened the door for me.

The movie was about an old, poor Bolivian couple living in the middle of the desert.  The plot was pretty slow, but I tried to find the excitement of the movie.  I wasn’t sure if that was the right word for it.  At least I wanted Kent to know that I wanted to spend time with him.

But for the entire movie, I was just a nervous wreck.  For the first time ever, I wanted to hold someone’s hand—Kent’s hand.  But I knew that would’ve been a big no-no at BYU, at least on campus.  I wondered how he felt about me.

After the movie, he and I walked to Costa Vida, which was about a 10-minute walk.  “So what did you think of the movie?” Kent asked.

“It was interesting,” I replied.  “It was a different movie from others I've seen.”

“You were probably like, ‘That was the most boring thing I’ve ever seen.’  I didn’t expect the movie to be that slow.  It’s probably the first time you’ve watched a movie like that, and it might be your last.  But what movies have you watched?”

“I’ve watched some Disney.”

“SOME Disney?  Only some?  Like what?”

“I like _Tangled_.  I also watched _Frozen_.  I heard there’s a _Frozen II_, but I think it came out on my mission.  I haven’t watched it though.”

“I watched _Frozen II_, and it was all right,” Kent said.  “I like the first one more though.  Maybe we could watch _Frozen II_ sometime.”

“So what was it like in Bolivia?  Were people pretty receptive to the gospel?”

“Yeah, they were definitely kind, though there were many times that people would flake on us.”

“I feel like that’s common anywhere.  Was it pretty diverse there?”

“There were mostly Hispanics, some from Central and South America.  There were also some Germans there too.”

“I’d say my favorite part of Seattle was the diversity.  It was mostly white in Kentucky, and it’s pretty white here in Provo, but there were people from all parts of the world in Seattle.  I liked getting to know their backgrounds and where they came from.”

Kent and I finally arrived at Costa Vida and got in line.  “I eat here a lot,” he said.  “Either here or Panda Express.”  Panda Express was right across the street.  “You can get whatever you want.  I can pay for you.”

“Oh, thank you,” I said.

“I’m glad that we could do this, and I’m glad that we can get to know each other.”

It felt kind of weird being in public and saying stuff like that.  “Thanks, me too,” I said shyly.

I knew the date wasn’t going to be extravagant, but it was sort of odd.  It felt like hanging out, even when I met Kent at the library or when I went on my date with Chris.  I guess I was subconsciously suppressing my feelings for Kent because I didn’t feel them as strongly as I did the past few days.  It was still nice to get to talk to each other, but it just didn’t feel... right.

After Kent and I finished our meal at Costa Vida, he and I were about to part ways at the traffic light.  It sounded like he was going to do something with one of his roommates.  “Well, it was really nice spending time with you!” Kent said.  He and I gave each other a hug.  “I feel so bad that you came along to watch the movie.”

I didn’t mind at all.  “No, don’t.  I’m glad I got to spend time with you,” I said.

“Aw, thanks.  Maybe we can plan on doing something next week.  By the way, how have you felt about your sexuality and being at BYU?  Have you had any sort of experiences with that?”

I shrugged and shook my head.  “I haven’t had any bad experiences,” I answered.  “I don’t make a big deal out of it.”

“That’s good.  I haven’t felt that way either.  And if people say shallow things to you, well, they’re just dumb.”

After that, Kent and I went our separate ways.  For some reason, I left feeling... kind of sad.  I wasn’t even sure if I wanted a kiss from him, but it sounded nice.  Maybe next time.

I was studying on the main floor of the library when I got a video call from Gyuna.  She called about getting some help from the labs.

That was it!  Maybe I could do video chats with Kent!  It wasn’t as great as meeting in person, but I thought it would be a lot better than texting each other.  Gyuna said she video chatted Christian every day.  I didn’t think Kent and I would video chat every day, but at least having short, frequent video chats would be nice.  It felt more authentic to me than texting.  So I texted Kent and asked what he thought of it.

...

November 12, 2022.  While I was studying at the library last night, I received a text from Shari inviting me to attend a pizza party with David and his relatives.  She was going to have a baby shower at someone else’s place.

David’s family and relatives definitely had a different family dynamic, which I was okay with, except that I never felt like I was part of the family.  I guess I wasn’t related by blood, but still.

After a few hours, I saw Shari come into the house.  The last time I saw her was on the Fourth of July.  She definitely looked a lot more pregnant now.

I also saw Deanna!  I was surprised since I didn’t know about the baby shower until last night.  I guess Deanna must have known about it for a while to fly from Connecticut.

“Have you tried your cookies ‘n cream milk?” Deanna asked.  Last Christmas when I spent time with Nozomu, her, and her family, she was surprised by how much I hadn’t experienced BYU stuff.

“I haven’t,” I answered.  I sort of forgot that was a thing.

“Well, my challenge to you is to drink one before we come here for Christmas.  Otherwise, I’ll buy you a bunch of cookies ‘n cream milk, and you’ll have to drink it all.”

After a short visit with Shari and Deanna, I headed out to go pick up Hyeji for dinner.  She was only a couple minutes away from where Shari and David lived, so I picked her up there.

“How was the test?” I asked when she got into the car.

“It was bad,” she answered.  “I didn’t pass, so I’ll probably take it again in January.”

Gyuna was down in Provo at Deseret Industries, so I picked her up there before we went off to Feast Buffet in the northern part of Orem.  It was about a 15-minute drive, and Gyuna and Hyeji spoke to each other in Korean for most of the time.  It was entertaining to hear them talk to each other.  It sounded like they felt comfortable talking.

Feast Buffet was pretty cheap for a buffet of its type, but it was pretty good.  I ate only one slice of David’s pizza so that I wouldn’t get too full, but I guess it was still too much.  I didn’t eat as much as I had hoped.

“Eat some more!” Hyeji exclaimed after my second plate.

“I’m honestly pretty full,” I said.

“Really?  You get a bunch of chow mein?  You get the cheap stuff?” Gyuna said.  “So picky.  You’re just eating more pasta!”

“Chow mein is good,” I said with a mouthful of it.

“So you said that you knew Gyuna from your mission?” Hyeji asked.

“Yeah, we served in Seattle,” I answered.  “I was serving in the Korean branch there when she came into the mission.”

“Wow, that’s cool!  I’m actually not a member.  I’ve taken the discussions before, but I always felt a lot of pressure from the missionaries, so I’ve not met them anymore.”

“Yeah, you definitely shouldn’t feel pressured to do anything,” I said.

“So out of all places, how did you find BYU?” Gyuna asked.

“I just typed ‘cheapest colleges in the US,’ and BYU was at the top,” Hyeji answered.  “And even though I’m not a member, it’s still pretty cheap.  But leaving Korea was really hard.  I literally cried on my way to the airplane.”

“I TOTALLY know what that feels like,” Gyuna said.  “I went to BYU-Idaho for college before coming down here, and when I flew to the US, I was so scared and cried too.”

“I came to the US when COVID was still pretty bad, and I heard a lot about the ‘stop Asian hate’ movement here.  It was really scary.  I didn’t know if I’d be safe living here.”

Gyuna, Hyeji, and I were in the restaurant for about three hours just eating and talking.  Afterwards, I dropped them off.  What they didn’t know was that I had plans for tonight: another date.

...

The date I was going on tonight was with a guy named John.  He and I planned to drive around, so he picked me up at my apartment around 8.  Again, I prayed that I would be safe.

“Hey.  John, right?” I greeted as I hopped inside his car.

“Yeah,” he said.  “And you’re Michael?”

“Yeah.  Nice to meet you.”  Again, it was a little awkward that I was meeting these people on dating apps in person.  But it was the goal.

It was another sort of awkward date.  John didn’t talk too much.  He seemed a bit nervous and giggly for some reason.  “So are you LDS?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I answered.

“Oh, me too!”

“Are you going to BYU?”

“No, I do BYU-Pathway.  I’m thinking I might end up doing mechanical engineering, but I’m not entirely sure yet.  So when did you know you were gay?”

“I remember feeling something for a guy when I was seven,” I answered.  “I didn’t think much about it.  But when I was 10, I really began to notice.  I suppressed those feelings though.  But I’ve learned that I can’t live to be alone my entire life.  I can’t continue to suppress these feelings.  What about you?”

“I started to notice that I had feelings for guys when I was in high school.  And when I went on my mission, that was when I really noticed those feelings.  Have you come out to anyone?”

“No,” I answered.  “Not even to my closest friends or family.”

“I’ve come out to a few people in my family.  I kind of did it weird though.  I just sent them a text, and I think it ended up spreading to other people.  But you definitely have to be careful about who you come out to.  I came out to past roommates, and they began to treat me differently.  Like, they’d get nervous being around me.  So I didn’t have a good experience with that.”

John had driven around for about 10 minutes when he parked the car up on a ledge at Rock Canyon.  “You’re really cute,” he said.  “Have you ever kissed a guy before?”

“I haven’t,” I replied.  I started to get nervous.  I was curious what it would be like to kiss a guy, but I didn’t feel like I knew John that well.

“Do you want to kiss?”

I thought for a long moment.  I wanted my first kiss to be Kent, but I was pretty curious what it would feel like to kiss.  “Sure.”

John leaned in until I said, “I’ve never done this before.  I’m really nervous.”  I didn’t realize until this moment, but I remembered hearing people talk about how Rock Canyon and Squaw Peak were make-out spots.  I was usually turned off when people mentioned it, but I should’ve listened.  I didn’t realize that John was planning on doing this.

“It’s okay.  Just relax,” he said.

And that was when I had my first kiss.  It was sort of weird: definitely not what I had imagined it to be.  And it wasn’t just lips involved.  John was trying to put his tongue inside my mouth, so I tried to do the same.

He and I kissed for a few minutes.  It honestly didn’t feel like it was that long.  But it left me with a sour taste in my mouth, maybe even literally.  I didn’t understand why people made such a big deal about kissing.

John took me back home, where we set up another date.  Honestly, I didn’t even know if our make-out session was considered a “date,” but at least he said that we could eat out somewhere next time.

That was the day when I found out what “making out” was.  I had heard the term a lot before, and I knew it had a lot to do with kissing, but that was about it.  Never realized how much tongue was involved.

I felt kind of bad that my first kiss wasn’t Kent.  The thing though was that I still hadn’t heard anything from him about video chatting.

## Section 4

November 13, 2022.  Instead of going to my local ward, Gyuna and I decided to go to one of the Asian wards.  She invited a couple of her friends as well.  Church started an hour later than we thought, so we hung out at the JSB taking pictures.

Afterwards, Gyuna and I went to her place.  She planned on cooking for a bunch of Korean people she had met the past week.  I sat on the couch while she took out her cutting board and knife.

“Michael, you were so cute in those pictures!” she exclaimed.  “Why don’t you go get yourself a wife?  And again, you can adopt me.  I’ll cook for you all the time, and I’ll make purchases on Amazon all day.”

Ever since Kent and I had that conversation at the library about coming out to someone, I thought a lot about Gyuna.  And when I went to Gyuna’s place before my date just a couple days ago, I felt strongly impressed to come out to her.  It kept coming to mind.  But I was SO scared!

It was even weirder that Gyuna had brought up about my fake future wife.  I didn’t know how to come out to her.  “Uh…” I said.

“What?”

I sighed.

“What??  You look like something’s on your mind.”

My heart raced.  “Yeah,” I nervously chuckled.

“Are you gonna tell me?”

“I will.”

“When?  Like, in a week?  Or right now?  Do you have to think about what you’re going to say?”

“Yeah, I just need to think about how to say it."

Gyuna continued to chop some vegetables.  “I’m just saying, once you get yourself a girl you’ll fall in love with, you’ll understand.”

For five minutes, my heart was racing like crazy.  I just needed to open my mouth and say it!  “So…”

Gyuna continued chopping.  “Huh?” she asked as if I had said something more.

I sighed and squirmed.  Why couldn’t I do it?!

“So… I actually like guys.”

It was silent for about three seconds.  With a surprised expression on her face, Gyuna paused and looked up at me.  The tense silence felt like FOREVER.  “What?” she asked as if she misheard me.

“I like guys,” I repeated.  I was SO nervous.

“Aw, Michael.” She put down her knife.  “I think I should give you hug.”  She walked over and gave me a long hug.  And it was one of the few times when I didn’t mind that she touched me.

“I’ve been so scared,” I said as she and I continued to hug.  “I’ve wanted to tell you this, but I was so scared.  You’re the first person I’ve come out to.  Literally I haven’t told anyone else.”

“Really?!” Gyuna sounded surprised.  “I feel so honored!  I can’t believe that after all the days of class I’ve missed and all the help I’ve needed on our data science labs that I’d be the first one to know something so personal like this.  No one has ever come out to me.  So it’s my first too!”

“It’s my first, and it’s your first.  It’s our first!”

Gyuna and I laughed.  “Sounds weird, but yeah,” she said.  “Oh, Michael!  Your lips are twitching so much.  And your fingers!”

“I know, I’m so freaking nervous!  I’ve had these feelings for guys for a long time, but I’ve always suppressed them.  After my mission, I thought I was going to live single for the rest of my life.”

“Aww, Michael!  That’s really sad!” Gyuna exclaimed.

“When I got my internship offer at AT&T, I thought that if I liked the job and received a full-time offer that I’d move to Dallas and work and then do whatever at home by myself.  But I’ve realized that I can’t live a life like that forever.  It would be so hard, maybe even impossible.  I know that faith and feelings can seem like polar opposites, but I don’t feel like it’s a black-and-white thing where I can choose only one and leave the other behind.  I don’t plan on leaving the Church until the Church kicks me out.  The thing that’s hard for me to understand is why God would allow people to have feelings for the same gender.  It’s not something that I have any control over.”

“Well, why does God allow someone to murder someone else?”  I guess Gyuna was trying to show compassion, although I didn’t feel like her analogy was at the same level.  “Love is such a core part of one’s identity.  It’s definitely a difficult situation when it comes to feelings of love.”

Gyuna and I sat on the couch and talked for an hour.  I talked to her about how I had been using dating apps and had been on a few dates.  I also talked to her about how much I liked Kent and my date with him.

After our conversation, Gyuna went back to cooking.  I knew I took up a lot of her time, and the people she had invited were coming soon.  “Could I help you?” I asked.

“Yes, please!” she answered.  So we made food together as her friends came by.

After I finished eating, I had plans to go to campus since Hyeji wanted to study with me.  As I left, Gyuna walked me out.  “Be safe!” she exclaimed.

“I will!  I’ll see you later!”

Coming out to Gyuna was one of the hardest things I did the past school year.  But a feeling of relief came over me.  I remembered Kent and Chris telling me how hard it must have been not coming out to anyone, and maybe that feeling of relief came from an unknown burden that had been lifted from my shoulders.  I don't like to think about what the past school year would've been like if I hadn't come out to her.

## Section 5

November 14, 2022.  Gyuna and I met at the basement of the Talmage Building in one of the soundproof study pods tonight.  She and I were stuck on a data science lab that was going to be due that night.  Plus, I wanted to tell her more about Kent.

“He asked me what my type of humor is, and I didn’t know how to answer that,” I said.  “What would you say is my type of humor?”

“You’re very direct and to the point,” Gyuna answered.  “And what’s even better is that you’re not intentionally mean or offensive.  You just state what’s on your mind, so it can come off humorous.”

Some people had told me that before.

“Do you have pictures of him?  Is he Caucasian?” Gyuna asked.

 “Yeah, he’s Caucasian,” I answered as I pulled up Instagram.  “I’d say that I like white guys.  This is him.”

She took my phone and scrolled through his pictures.  “Really?” she said in an unenthusiastic voice.  “You like him?  And he has so many followers.  He must be one of those popular white kids that I wouldn’t get along with.  He’s not really my type either.  By the way… do you like Christian?”

“No,” I answered.  “He’s not my type.”

“He’s not your type?  But he’s so cute!  He’s got nice curly hair.  I mean, I guess I didn’t think I’d have feelings for him on our first date, but he’s cute!  But I guess it’s good that you don’t have feelings for him.  Otherwise, I don’t know if we’d still be friends.”

“The first guy that I matched with was on Hinge, and his name is Connor.  He served his mission in Sapporo and is studying information systems.  I think he’s pretty cute too.”  I showed pictures of him as well.

Gyuna didn’t look impressed.  “Hm, he’s not my type either.  You like ugly guys.”

“Uh, what?  You definitely don’t have good taste then.  Connor and Kent are really cute!”

“Can I see your Tinder?  I want to see you go through some guys to see what exactly your type is.”

I was a little nervous about it.  “I honestly don’t swipe right on a lot of guys,” I said.  “I’m not really into guys who dress like girls or guys that have lots of piercings or guys that have long hair.  I’d say that out of 20 guys, I might swipe right once or twice.”

“What, only that little?  It’s hard to actually know someone until you meet them in person.  It’s rare to find someone where you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m in love with this guy!’ just based on a profile and some pictures.”  She then took a look at my Tinder profile.  “What are these pictures?  It looks like a LinkedIn profile.  Bro, we need to get you some better pics.”

Gyuna watched me as I went through a list of guys.  “Nope, nope.  Mm, nope,” I said as I swiped left.  “Nope.  Oh, maybe him.  Wait, no, he smokes weed.  Nope, nope, no—”

“WAIT!” Gyuna exclaimed.  “He’s HOT!”

“Really?”  I looked at his picture again and shrugged.

“Let me look at his profile, and let ME be the judge of him,” she said as she took my phone.  “OH MY GOSH!  Look at this!  He likes REGGAETON!  Maybe we’ll see him at Fuego!  AND HE LIKES BOBA TEA?!  Michael!  You HAVE to swipe right on him!”

“But he’s not my type.”

“PLEASE!  Just for me?”

I sighed.  I swiped right, just for her.

“Good!” she approved.  “And if you two match, let me know because I want to meet this guy!”

I never matched with him.

I swiped right on maybe three or four guys out of a bunch of profiles.  Half of them were because Gyuna wanted me to swipe right.

“Dang, you’re really picky,” Gyuna said after that exercise.  “From what you’ve talked to me about Kent and Connor, it sounds like you like bougie, church-looking, white guys.”

“Uh, I don’t know about that,” I said.  “But yeah, I think being financially stable is attractive.  And being intelligent.  At the end of my date with Kent on Friday, I sort of wished he didn’t leave, but I was like, ‘Thanks for spending time with me.’”

Gyuna looked shocked for a moment.  “Oh my gosh!” she exclaimed.  “That look you just gave me!”  I guess I gave her a seductive look.  (I didn’t know what “seductive” meant at the time, but that’s probably the most accurate word to use.)  “I literally got the chills.  Dang, I can tell you really like him.  I’ve never seen you like this!  This is so amazing!”

“I had the idea of video chatting Kent, just short but frequent calls.  I remember you and I video chatting later that night, and it felt natural.  Like, we feel comfortable just doing something like that.  Plus, I know you said that you video chat with Christian every day.  So I texted Kent about the idea, but I haven’t heard from him.”

“Hm, that's a little fishy,” Gyuna said.

“When did you and Christian start video chatting?”

“I can call him right now.”  So Gyuna did.  “Hey, look who I’m with.”  She turned the camera towards me.

“Hey, baby girl,” Christian said to me as he made smooching noises.

“Uh, hey,” I responded.

After some talk, Gyuna asked, “Do you remember when we started video chatting regularly?”

“It wasn’t too long after we started dating,” Christian answered.

After some more chat, Gyuna hung up.  “What if I video chatted Kent right now?” I asked.

Gyuna looked surprised.  “That would be scary.  I wouldn’t do that, but you do you.”

“I mean, he didn’t say anything, so he didn’t say no.  I feel like he’d have to tell me that before I’d understand that he wouldn’t want that.”  I sighed.  “I might actually do it.”

“Dang, okay, Michael.  You’re so brave.  I’ll just be listening in the background.”

I sighed again.  “I’m so freaking nervous!  But I’m going to do it.”  I opened my phone to the Messenger app.  “By the way, I plan on telling him that I came out to you if that’s okay.”

“Yeah, of course.”

I pressed the video call button and waited.  After two or three seconds, I noticed that he hung up on me.

“Hm, he didn’t answer,” I said.

After a few minutes, I got a text:

```Kent: Hey Michael! I’m so sorry, I’m drowning in homework rn😭😭. But how are you doing??```

I showed the text to Gyuna.  I was texting back a reply when she said, “Michael, that’s not a good text.  Let me text him.”

```Me: Hey```

“Oops, that accidentally sent,” she said.

“Oh my gosh, Gyuna!  That’s so embarrassing!”

She crafted a text to send Kent.  Of course, I made some adjustments to it until we both agreed on what would be good to send.

```Me: Oops that accidentally got sent through lol. I’m doing homework too lol but just give me a call when u have time :)```

But the entire time, I was looking at my phone, hoping that Kent would call.

“I’ll have to introduce you to him at some point,” I said.  “He’s a really nice guy.  And it would be good to make connections.”

After some more talking, it was nearing midnight.  Thankfully, Gyuna and I were able to finish our data science lab in time, and we packed up.

“Kent said that he usually studies on the second floor of the library in a quiet area,” I said as we were walking outside.  “Who knows, maybe he was studying there.”

“Do you want to make a quick stop to the library?” Gyuna asked.

I saw that a lot of people were exiting the library.  “Hm, maybe not,” I decided.  “Usually the last 15 minutes is when they try to clear the library.  Plus, Kent might already be gone by this point.”

“Dang, you don’t let your heart take over your head.  You’re so good.”

We got to the point on campus where Gyuna and I parted ways to go home.  “Well, I might see you tomorrow?” I said.  “It’s too bad that I didn’t get to hear from Kent.”

“Yeah, I’ll see you soon.  And don’t worry, things are really new for you, so don’t let Kent get to your head too much!”

As Gyuna and I parted ways, I checked my phone to see that I had gotten a text:

```Kent: Hey Michael! Sorry it’s so late, I just finished! Just so you know, I’m happy to hang out with you and get to know you more, but probably more as a friend instead of a romantic interest, I’m sorry! I thought I should be upfront about it. But you really are amazing! And I still would love to talk to you about anything you are frustrated or worried about because I know how hard this journey can be sometimes! You’re such a cool guy!```

## Section 6

My heart almost stopped.  Did I really just read what I thought I had read?  I panicked the entire way back to my apartment.  I had to read that text message again when I got home.

So… he actually didn’t like me?  As in, he didn’t like me in a romantic way?  I was so confused.  I totally thought he liked me!

I had never felt so much emotional pain, not like this before.  It was even like a physical pain, as if something had hit my heart.  I just wanted to bury my head in my pillow and scream.  But my roommates were asleep, and they probably would’ve thought I had gone crazy considering that they didn’t know anything about my life.

Was this what people meant when they said they were “heartbroken”?  Was it really this painful?

I sent a screenshot of Kent’s text to Gyuna.

```Gyuna: Awwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee nooooooooooooooooo```

```Me: What do I say to that?```

```Gyuna: I don’t know..what do u want to say?```

```Me: I feel really…sad. I don’t know if I can see him as just a friend. But I want to be okay with it. I still want to have good ties with him. He was my first date.```

```Gyuna: Hey it’s okay! It’s just one date and there are plennttttty of better guys waiting for u. I’m so sorry I know u were so excited… let me know if u need anything```

So I sent Kent the following text:

```Me: Hey, thanks for being honest with me. Dang, so this is what it feels like to be heart broken! I wanted to let you know that I came out to Gyuna yesterday. I felt like it would’ve been better to tell you than over text. It was really scary telling her, but she’s been very supportive. I hope we can be friends though. I just don’t know how to make it so that I can see you as just a friend. What do you think?```

I tried to fall asleep, but the emotional and physical pain were so sharp.  I couldn’t believe this was an emotion!  After about half an hour I texted Gyuna.

```Me: I can’t fall asleep. I’m really, really sad. Why can’t he like me back?```

```Gyuna: Hey there’s nothing wrong with you as he said! U r an amazing guy, but we don’t have power over somebody’s feelings or forcing them. Maybe he is just not ready for you right now maybe it’s something else, and if you keep on thinking, you will only go into the rabbit hole. If he is right for you, it will happen at the right time. If not, you will find someone who you will like so much and love! You are stellar and you will be happy and find love in your own time, another stellar one just for you. I love you babe stay strong!```

```Me: I’ve just been crying all night. I literally feel like such a teenager. I just wish he’d like me!!```

```Gyuna: Awe.. I wish I was there to hug you and be with you. I know, only if it was that easy!!```

```Me: It’s so frickin hard! I wish there was another guy there for me, but I just don’t see it. Even with the guy that I’ll be going on a date with on Saturday, idk how I feel about it. I mean, I’m not as into him as I thought, but then I’d be my own Kent to him…```

```Gyuna: As hurtful as it is, it is a natural process of finding someone to date. It’s natural, and a journey to take on for everybody to find that one person who you will love and who will love you back even more. It applies equally to you, Kent, and the other guy. You can’t force yourself or anybody else to like someone and be liked```

```There are three songs that I think might help you! Cry as much as you need and let those feelings wash out. And have a knock out sleep Michael!```

I didn’t get her last text until the following morning.  I felt like absolute trash when I woke up.  I didn’t want to go to class.  I didn’t want to do homework.  I didn’t want to do anything at all.  But I managed to get out of bed.

Gyuna had sent three songs, all of which had to do with love.  Those kinds of songs never made sense to me in the past, but as I really listened to the lyrics, I felt like I could actually relate to them.  What I used to find unrelatable and disgusting actually RESONATED with me!  Did other people go through these emotions too?

**_Here is one song that Gyuna sent me: “Like I Can” by Sam Smith._**

```(Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AjKWWk0KDQ)```

It wasn’t until I had class in the afternoon that I began to feel a bit better.  Maybe this was the end of it.  I could finally move on.

That was what I thought.  That evening, I was in the Talmage basement in one of the soundproof study pods.  Gyuna said she’d meet me there.  I began to feel really sad again.  I didn’t want to do homework at all!

“Hey,” Gyuna greeted.

“Hey,” I said unenthusiastically.

“Oh, Michael.  Is this your first time feeling heartbroken?”

“I guess that’s what I’m feeling.  I’ve never felt this way before, and it HURTS.  I freaking hate it!  Have you ever felt heartbroken?”

“Oh yeah.  I definitely have.  I think everyone has felt heartbroken at some point.  It’s part of life.”

“What was it like feeling heartbroken for you?”

“Well, when my ex and I broke up, it was really hard.  When he got back from his mission, he acted like he was avoiding me.  We didn’t tell a lot of people in the ward that we were dating, but it sounded like some things were getting spread around about us.  To make a long story short, when I was about to leave for my mission, I tried to talk things out with him, but he said that I needed to go find a better guy than him.  And I cried on the way to the MTC.”

“Wow, that sounds awful.  I can't imagine what it would be like to be in a relationship with someone and then break up.  Maybe I now know why it's so hard.”

“I know you were so excited for things to happen with Kent,” Gyuna tried consoling me.  “But trust me, there are SOOO many other guys better than him.”

“No there aren’t.”

“Who knows, things could’ve been worse.  Kent might be a psychopath, so you would’ve definitely dodged a bullet.”

“If Kent's a psychopath, anyone would be a psychopath.”

“Plus, Kent is ugly.  There are so many cuter-looking guys.”  It sounded like Gyuna’s taste in guys was an acquired one.

“I did listen to those songs you sent me,” I said.  “I remember listening to songs like those in the past and never understood what the lyrics meant, but now I feel like they RESONATED with me!”

“Really?!  I’m glad!  I’m so glad that you’re having these kinds of emotions, Michael.  Do you know Sam Smith?”

“I don’t.”

“He’s gay too.  And he’s Christian.  He’s pretty femme.  A lot of people called him a fagot and made fun of him for his appearance and sexuality.  And for years, he liked different guys who never liked him back.  For YEARS.  I’m sure he’s found someone who’s liked him that he’s also liked.”

“Is heartbreak really something that people know about?”  I was still a bit skeptical considering that I hadn’t ever felt like this in the 23 years of my life.

“Yes!  I’m sure your parents have felt heartbreak.  I’m sure your siblings have felt heartbreak too.  Everyone goes through it.  That’s why so many people make songs about love and heartbreak.  It’s something that everyone can relate to.  Not everyone is going to relate to knowing what it’s like to get a poor grade on an exam.  They’re not going to be like, ‘I made… a B on… my exaaaaaaam!’  No.  That’s not as relatable as love and heartbreak.”

Gyuna and I talked for a couple hours.  She probably could tell that I still felt absolutely miserable.  “Do you want to get ice cream?” she suggested.  “We could go to Baskin-Robbins.”

I sighed.  “Sure,” I answered.  “I honestly don’t feel like doing homework at all.  Might as well keep my mind occupied doing something else.”

But the walk to Baskin-Robbins was the same path that Kent and I had taken to Costa Vida, and it hurt.

“What?” Gyuna asked as I groaned.

“Literally Kent and I were walking this same sidewalk and talking about movies.  I miss him so freaking much!”

“Oh, Michael, you just need to get over it.  It’ll be okay.”

“No, it won’t be…”

We got some ice cream and talked some more.  Afterwards, Gyuna and I walked home.  I decided to go down the road she was going to take before we went our separate ways.

“Oh SHOOT!” I cried.

“What?” Gyuna asked.

“Costa Vida is right there.  That’s where Kent and I went.”

“Okay, okay, okay.  Just don’t look.  Turn the other way.  Michael!  Turn the other way!”

I sighed and turned the opposite way.

“What if I knocked you over with my scooter and gave you a concussion?” Gyuna suggested.  “Then you’ll forget about Kent and won’t have to feel this way.”

“But I don’t want to forget about him…  But I freaking hate feeling this way…  But I felt so good knowing him…”

After some walking, I thought, “You know what, what if we took some pictures right now?  This is a first experience for me.  I’ve never felt this way before, and I want to remember this day as my first full day of heartbreak.”

“Really?” Gyuna sounded surprised.  “I’m glad you want pictures.  This is quite an eventful moment.  And don’t worry, you WILL get over this heartbreak.  The first one is always really, really tough though.”

So we took some pictures.  And Gyuna took a video of me explaining how heartbroken I felt.  She didn’t send that video to me though.  “I’m going to send it a year from now so that you can see how you felt,” she said.  (She better show me that video in November.)

“Do you know Lady Gaga?” Gyuna asked.

“I’ve heard of her, but I don’t really know her,” I said.

“She’s a strong advocate for the LGBTQ community.  She has this one song where she’s like, ‘It doesn’t matter if you love him or capital H-I-M.’”  She played the song on her phone.  “‘Capital H-I-M!’”

She and I continued to talk until we parted ways.  “It was good seeing you,” I said.  “Thanks for spending time with me and helping me deal with these feelings.”

“Of course.  And know that you’re definitely not the only person who’s felt the way you do.  I’ll see you later!”

I still felt a lot of pain inside, but it was so nice getting to talk to Gyuna.  I wondered what would’ve happened if I hadn’t come out to her when I did.  It would’ve been SO difficult for me to have to go through this by myself.

...

November 16, 2022.  Kent and I had texted each other for a bit the past couple days.  I genuinely wanted to be friends with him, but I was scared that I would hurt myself with these feelings for him.  But even before I began dating, I had in mind that I’d try to be friends or at least be positively acquainted with the guys I’d date.  Again, I felt like a divide in our small pool of guys at BYU would be extremely detrimental.  It must have been so difficult having to navigate through life with these feelings, so I wanted to do my best to at least keep in contact with those I met.

Kent and I decided to meet at the library to study for about an hour.  I also wanted to introduce Gyuna to him.  We studied for a bit, but we mostly talked.  Initially, I didn’t know how open he was talking about dating and relationships, but he was pretty open.  He did text me that he wanted to support me and to ask him any questions I had.

“Have you ever felt heartbroken?” I asked him in the middle of the conversation.

“Oh yeah, definitely,” Kent answered.  “During my freshman year, one of my roommates was a really touchy person.  And I’m kind of the same way too.  When we’d watch movies, he and I would cuddle on the couch, and I thought it was rather unusual because guys usually aren’t like that.  Near the end of the school year, I came out to him, and he was respectful about it, but he started to date one of the girls within our friend group.  So that was really hard for me.  But now he’s married to her, and I still sometimes keep in contact with him.”

That was interesting.  I never thought that having feelings for a roommate could happen.  I always assumed guys were straight unless they said otherwise.  “How long were you with your boyfriend?” I asked.  “And what would you say is different about being in a relationship?"

"I'd say it's more about commitment.  Like, you don't plan on dating anyone else.  But I dated my boyfriend for only about three or four months.  It didn't really go well.  Our personalities were pretty different as we got to know each other more, and he was pretty political too.  If I told him that I disagreed, he'd get kind of heated.  But I mean, he's still a good guy.  Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what I want romantically.  I feel like the first few relationships are rough, and they probably won't end up working out.  There's definitely a difference between being friends and being romantically connected with someone.  But I really hope you feel like you can still reach out to me if you have any questions because I know what it was like being in your shoes a year ago.”

I continued, “What would you say is your type?”

“I do like darker-skinned people.  I think that had to do with serving my mission in Bolivia, though my ex is white.  But I’ve dated all different kinds of people.  Members, non-members, white people, Hispanic people…  It’s been a good learning experience.  What about you?  What is your type?”

“I do like Caucasian guys, but it’s so hard to find people I feel like would be a good match.  A bunch of people smoke weed or do drugs, and I don’t want that.  If I were shown 20 profiles, I’d probably swipe right on one or two of them.”

“That little?  You don’t give that many people a chance, huh?  When I first started dating guys, I used to swipe right only on people I thought looked attractive because of my experiences with dating girls.  But I’ve learned that good-looking guys can sometimes be d-bags.  It’s hard to know what people are like judging them based off an online profile.”

Gyuna had said the same thing to me.  Maybe I needed to focus more on people’s bios than their pictures.  Of course, I still didn’t want to date crackheads.  I also told him about my matches.  He seemed to know a lot of people in the gay community.  I guess it was pretty small here.  “Do you know Connor?” I asked.

“Oh yeah, I know Connor!” Kent said.  “He and I were in the same ward a couple years ago.  He’s super cool and nice.  Kind of a nerd too.”

“I had asked him if he and I could go on a date, and on the day that you and I first met here, he told me no to a date.  He said he needs some time to work on himself.  I’m not sure what he means by that.  Do you think you’d know why he said no?”

“Hm, I’m not sure.  But I’d give him some time before you ask him again.”

We studied a bit but ended up talking more.  “When I get comfortable around people, I sometimes go a bit crazy,” Kent said.

“What do you mean?” I asked.  He didn’t seem like he was crazy.

“When I’m home by myself, I usually like to sing out loud and dance.  Don’t you do that?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

“Really?  Don’t you ever let your emotions loose?”

“I wouldn’t say I’m that emotional of a person.  I’m pretty stoic.  I’d say I’m pretty much the same person by myself as I am around other people.”  Maybe Gyuna was right.  Maybe Kent was a psychopath.  “I think I’ve learned that these emotions are a risk of dating.  I mean, I’ve never felt the way that I did before.  And I know you weren’t trying to be intentionally hurtful.”

“Heartbreak is super painful, but <u>I’d rather go through the emotions of the joy of dating and the pain of heartbreak than to feel nothing at all.</u>”  That was an interesting statement.  It stuck with me.

I checked my phone to see that Gyuna had texted saying she ended up not having class, so she was at the library.  After giving her a call to meet us, I saw her and waved.  “Hey, this is Kent.  Kent, this is Gyuna.”

“Hey, nice to meet you,” Gyuna said.

“Nice to meet you too, Gyuna!”  Kent said.  “I’ve heard a lot about you.”

Gyuna turned to me.  “Really?  Well, I hope he didn’t say anything nasty about me.”

The two of them talked for a bit.  Eventually, Kent had to go, and Gyuna and I were planning to go to Brick Oven shortly.

“Good to see you, Michael,” Kent said as we departed.  He gave me a pat on my shoulder.

“Good to see you too,” I said, returning a pat on his shoulder.

After Kent left, Gyuna made that shocked expression of hers.  “Okay, dang,” she said.  “I guess I know why you find him attractive.  He’s definitely better in person.  And he’s pretty nice.”  Her expression changed.  “But he still broke your heart, so I’m not happy about him.”

“Well, how else would he have been able to tell me?” I asked.  “I also realized that on his Tinder profile, it said that he was looking to make new friends.  And I could tell that he wasn’t trying to be intentionally hurtful.  I’d rather him be honest about it.”  I told Gyuna about what Kent had told me about his heartbreak experience.

“Yeah, that’s another situation where someone doesn’t love you back.  But, Michael, you shouldn’t talk about heartbreak like this with everyone.”

“Why not?  You said it’s something everyone goes through, so people can relate, right?  Even Kent said the same thing.”

“Well, especially when you’re dating other people, it’s kind of a jerk move to talk about past heartbreaks.”  I still didn’t get what she meant.  “But don’t tell Kent all the details about how heartbroken you felt about him, all right?”

Well.  Okay.

“He told me that he’s into dark-skinned guys, and he liked his ex-boyfriend’s curly hair,” I said.

“Oh yeah, he served his mission in Bolivia, right?  Dark skin and curly hair?  Then he better stay away from Christian.  I’m not letting Kent get close to him.  Actually, speaking of Christian, when you sent a screenshot of Kent’s text to me the other night, I instinctively was like, ‘Nooooooo!’  And Christian was like, ‘What happened?’  I told him about one of my friends back in Korea.  She’s a bit quiet like you and can be shy when it comes to dating.”  Coming out to Gyuna but not to Christian was one thing I was a bit hesitant about.  I felt like he’d figure it out from her somehow.

Gyuna told me that an international program was going to host an info session with free pizza at Brick Oven, so we went there.  “I matched with this one guy named Jonah,” I said as I showed her pictures of him.  “He’s really cute.”

She scrolled through his profile.  “Daaaaaang, Michael!” Gyuna exclaimed.  “Yeah, he IS cute!  There we go!  You’ve finally found someone who’s not ugly.  Have you messaged him?”

“I did, but he hasn’t responded yet.  But you know what, God is good.  He’s putting other guys in my path, even though I still feel like there’s no one else out there except Kent.  But I wonder if Jonah is texting other guys…”

“Ohhh, is Michael feeling jealous?”  I never understood why people acted so jealous when a boyfriend or girlfriend would “flirt” with other people, but now I began to understand.  Wow.  It made more sense.

I shrugged.  “Dang, Kent is going to love some guy, and that guy is going to be so lucky.”

“You know, I’ve definitely seen a change in you, Michael,” Gyuna said.  “The past couple of weeks, you’ve been a lot more expressive.  Before that, you were SO unexpressive.  You were like, ‘Define “like.”’  And I’m like, ‘Bro.’  And anytime I gave you compliments and stuff, you were just like, ‘Oh.  Thanks.’”  She and I laughed.  It was kind of true though.  I had changed a bit.  One thing I saw in myself was just how much more attractive guys looked ever since I started dating.  Like dang, there were some good-looking guys at BYU!  Of course, I still assumed they were all straight unless they said otherwise.

“You know, I’m glad that you and Kent met up so soon,” Gyuna said.  “I knew that if you were going to wait a couple weeks that you’d probably not see him again.”

“Well, I do hope to make friends in the gay community.  It would be so detrimental if we weren’t there for each other.  And I think Kent would be a good friend to me.”

A few hours later when I got home, I finally heard back from Jonah!

```Me: HE TEXTED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!```

```😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍```

```Gyuna: YAAAAAAAAASSSSSS BABYYYYYYYYY```

```👏👏👏```

```🤩🤩🤩```

```Me: #capitalHIM```

```Gyuna: #godisgood```

```😂😂😂```

```😍😍😍```

```I'm so excited for iuuuu```

```Me: I hope it goes well. Frick! I can't get too excited because what if it doesn't end up working out?```

```Then I'll be heartbroken all over again.```

Well, my skepticism kinda turned out to be right.  He didn’t text that frequently, and then he eventually just stopped.  Dang.  I didn’t like getting ghosted, and I couldn’t believe he did that to me.  After experiencing my first heartbreak with Kent, I really, really didn’t want to go through it again.  Plus, I was still sort of recovering from it.  But I hoped that Kent and I could be friends.  I was going to take his word about him being supportive and letting him know what I was going through.

...

November 18, 2022.  Erika invited me to her birthday party, and she invited some other people within the Paducah stake, including Carli.  I hadn’t seen her since her birthday party.  “So, any updates you have since we last talked?” she asked me.

“I got an internship offer with AT&T, so I’ll be doing that next summer,” I answered.  “What about you?”

“That’s so exciting!  I’ve been applying to medical school, and I’ll actually be going back to Kentucky soon, so I’m excited.  I’ve got interviews with UK and U of L.”

“Are you still dating that one guy?” I was surprised that I asked such a thing.  I usually didn’t have any interest in dating and relationships.  “I forgot his name.”

“Oh, are you talking about Zach?  No, he and I aren’t a thing anymore.  But I’m dating a guy in Paducah Ward.  His name is Ben.  Do you know him?”

“I don’t think so.  How old is he?”

Carli laughed.  “He’s a lot older than me.”

“Oh, I thought you were going to say he was 18 or something.”

“No, he’s definitely older than me.”

“Like how much older?”

Carli hesitated.  “Uh…  I’ll just say he’s much older than me.  But I’ll be getting to see him too, so I’m excited about that.”

“That sounds fun.”  I couldn’t believe I said that.  But I was beginning to realize that I could empathize with other people.  I could empathize how Carli must have been excited to see this old guy named Ben… kind of.

I left the party after a couple hours since I planned on going to Fuego with Gyuna and Christian.  For the past two months, they had been trying to convince me to go.  Since it was the week before Thanksgiving, I decided to go since I knew I’d have time to do stuff later.  So I went to Gyuna’s place.

“Go drink some Red Bull,” she said.  “You’ll need some energy.”

“I’ve never had an energy drink,” I said.

“I have to drink a Red Bull before I dance so that I get energy.  Sometimes I’ll drink more than one.  But for now, let me pour you a cup.”

Gyuna had also invited a bunch of other people who had never been to Fuego, so I was glad I wasn’t the only newbie.  It was around 11pm when they showed up to give us a ride.

I still couldn’t say I was a party person, but it was better than I thought it would be.  A huge part of it was Gyuna.  Sure, she wasn’t the greatest at coding, and she liked to procrastinate a lot, but one of her greatest strengths was how inclusive she was.  She was aware of the people she associated with, and she knew how to help them have fun.  I needed someone like that in my life.  Otherwise, I’d have such a boring life.  She and Christian did their best to make all the people they invited feel like they were having a good time.

...

November 19, 2022.  I had two dates tonight: a second date with John and a first date with a guy named Roger.

John and I got food at Panda Express.  He and I vibed even less, at least that was how I felt.  It wasn’t like he was disrespectful towards strangers, but he didn’t show that much respect towards them either.  I learned that kindness and respect—especially towards strangers— were qualities that I found attractive.  He didn’t have that.

Not only that, but after we got our food, he drove up to the Y Mountain parking lot, and he wanted to cuddle and make out.  I couldn’t find myself being able to say no; there was a part of me that wanted physical touch.  But I felt a bit disgusted when he cuddled, and I was left with a sour taste in my mouth again after making out.  Again, I didn’t feel like I was on a date: it was just another make-out session.

John asked me if I’d be down to go hiking sometime next week before Thanksgiving break.  Part of me wanted to say no because this “date” made me feel even less for him, but another part of me didn’t want to say no because I wanted to at least keep an acquaintance with those in the gay community.  Plus, the fact that Kent had broken my heart was something I didn’t want to do to John.

My date with Roger was a lot better though.  He and I went to watch _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_.  It was my first Marvel movie, so I didn’t understand what was going on.  But at least it was a new experience for me.

Afterwards, he and I got hot chocolate at a shop downtown, and we talked for about an hour or two in the car.  “I haven’t come out to my parents,” I said in the middle of our conversation.  “I’ve thought about it, but it doesn’t feel right.  The only person I’ve come out to is my best friend.  And I’ve gotten my heart broken by this one guy.  When people told me they felt heartbroken, I thought, ‘Oh, they’re sad, but they’ll be fine after a few hours.’  No.  It’s been five days, and I haven’t gotten over it yet.  I’ve never felt this way before.  Have you ever felt heartbroken?”

“I can’t say that I’ve felt heartbroken, but there have been some difficult experiences,” Roger answered.  “Actually, there was this one guy from Brazil where I thought he and I would get serious, but he wanted to marry me just so he could get a green card or something like that.  I served my mission in Korea, and I had one companion that I got along with really well.  We were companions for a long time.  I learned that he was gay, and he told me that we should go home early and start a relationship.  I was like, ‘Nah.’  He ended up getting sent home, and he sort of threatened me to come home or else he would never talk to me again.  After a bit, he blocked me on social media, and I haven’t talked to him since.  So that was a bit sad, especially since he and I got along so well.”

“Dang.  I’m still trying to figure out how to overcome these feelings of heartbreak.  It’s not easy.  But now I know what people mean, at least from my experiences.”  I told him about what led me to start dating guys.  He shared his story too.  Getting to know other guys’ stories was one of my favorite parts of dating.  Even though everyone had different circumstances, one thing we all had in common was that love was a lot deeper than the mechanics, and no one chose to have these feelings.

“I think for me, I had to overcome my own homophobia,” Roger continued.  “But I’ve come to learn that God is our loving Heavenly Father, and that’s what matters most.  He knows who I am, and I’ve learned that being gay is not a defect.  It’s just a part of who I am—of who we are—and that’s okay.  I’ve struggled a lot about what to do with my sexuality, and I’ve learned that it’s something that each of us can ask God about.  There's a guy in the BYU Office of Belonging who's gay, and I asked him what he's decided to do.  He said that he's prayed and thought a lot about what to do with his circumstances, and he's made the decision to be completely celibate.  I asked him, ‘How do you feel about that?’  He said, ‘I'm doing just that, but I'm not very happy with my life.  But it's up to you and God what you want to do with yours.’  For me, I feel that I can’t live to be single for the rest of my life and that dating girls isn’t a great option either.  I’ve talked to a few gay people who were married to women, and they said that things work out, except all of them are divorced now.  They've told me that while they're having sex, they just think of guys, which I think is absolutely wrong.  It's hurtful for the guy.  It's hurtful for his wife.  And it's hurtful for their children.”

Thinking about having sex with a girl disgusted my mind too.  I didn’t know how gay guys could do it.  “One thing I’ve learned on my mission is that going through the motions isn’t enough,” I said.  “At the beginning of my mission, I thought that I would be blessed merely following the mission rules.  And while that’s a starting point, that isn’t enough.  It wasn’t until later in my mission when I learned how to love the people I served that I felt happier and saw the blessings of serving a mission.  That important lesson is something that I’ve been trying to understand with my sexual orientation.  I could go through the motions of dating and marrying a woman, but would I really feel happy?  I don’t think so.  And even though I’ve been dating guys for only a couple weeks, I find it hard to understand why straight people can’t empathize with us.  They have desires to date and marry and raise a family, just like a lot of gay people do too.  Maybe because straight people make up the majority of society, they think that being straight is the ‘correct’ sexual orientation.  But regardless, based on how I’ve felt about girls and the experiences of other guys I’ve gone on dates with, I wonder if straight people would do as they say and marry someone of the same gender if that was what God wanted the world to be from the beginning.”

“I think we’re in a position where personal revelation is so important,” Roger said.  “Again, I think that God knows us better than anyone else does.”

Even though I didn’t feel anything romantic from Roger, he seemed chill.  He and I talked for a while, after which I dropped him off at his apartment.

...

November 21, 2022.  I had been texting Kent about my dates.  Gyuna told me that he probably knew about dating better than she did.  Plus, I didn’t think she wanted to hear every single detail about my dates.  I still wasn’t a fan of texting behind a screen though.  I tried arranging a time I could meet him at the library again.  He said he’d let me know when he’d be available, but he never texted me back.  I was discouraged.

Gyuna invited me to her place in the evening, and we ended up watching _Frozen II_.  I was on the brink of tears the entire movie though.

_(November 2022; college junior) “I watched_ Frozen II, _and it was all right,” Kent said.  “I like the first one more though.  Maybe we could watch_ Frozen II _sometime.”_

“Are you crying?” Gyuna asked.

“Yeah,” I answered.  It was at the part where Olaf was dying, but that obviously wasn’t the reason why I was crying.  After the movie, I said, "You're gonna hate me for saying this, but the entire time I was watching the movie, I wanted to break down and cry because it reminded me of my date with Kent and how he said that he and I could watch _Frozen II_ together sometime.  He seems to be on my mind all the time, and I talk about my heartbreak on my dates."

"Oh, I thought you were sad that Olaf died," Gyuna said.  "Wow, you're kind of a jerk when it comes to dating.  Talking about heartbreak with your other dates?  That can be so rude and uncomfortable."

"I want to stop feeling this way, but I can't.  Why does it have to hurt so much?  It hasn't even been a full week.  This literally happened last Monday night right before midnight.  It's felt like a WHOLE month!"

"Well, time does feel distorted when you're going through a heartbreak."  She ended up calling Christian since I was feeling pretty sad.  In the middle of their conversation, she asked, "How would you get over a girl you really liked?  Or what would you do if she broke your heart?"

"I'd just move on,” Christian answered.  “Just accept that this is the way it is.  I know some people cope with heartbreak by going into another relationship.  My ex-girlfriend did that, and she told me that this guy wasn't anything like me.  But she did that to herself."

"Yeah, I think that's kind of toxic.  But what would you do if you and I broke up?  Not saying that that’s gonna happen."

He paused.  "That would be really hard," Christian replied as he thought.  "I think I would need some time.  I probably wouldn't date for a while, but I think it differs from person to person."

"How long would you not date before you go back?"

"Probably a year."

A year?!  That was such a long time!  How could people wait for that long?

"But you'd be so lonely," Gyuna said.

"I think that's part of the process of heartbreak.  You have to go through those feelings."

"What if you met a girl who was really sweet and wanted to be around you?  Would you go on a date with her?"

"Again, I think I’d wait for a bit before dating again."

Maybe after a few months of dating, I’d probably feel like I could be more patient with finding someone, maybe because I’d become more skeptical.  I wondered how people were able to find each other and actually go on dates in the first place.  Maybe I did need a short break from dating until my feelings for Kent stopped, but who knew when that would happen.  I decided to give myself some space and not text him until I felt normal.

Later, John texted me saying that he wanted to take me to his apartment after going on our hike.  I didn’t feel like going on another date with him though.  I didn’t directly tell him that I wasn’t interested, but I told him that I wanted to take a short break from dating until my feelings for Kent stopped.  (And in retrospect, I think it was a good idea that I didn’t go on that “date.”)

It wasn’t until a few weeks later after texting John that I discovered that not all guys had intentions of finding a long-term relationship.  I learned that when guys put in their bios that they wanted to “have fun,” they didn’t mean they wanted to eat at a nice restaurant or play board games or do anything that was actually fun.  No, “fun” for those guys meant making out or—worse—having sex.  It seemed like hookups were an actual thing.  But what was the point of doing something short-term like that?  And who knew if a guy was “having fun” with multiple guys?  I wondered how girls were able to deal with straight guys.  No wonder some fathers were so protective of their daughters.

Even though my initial desire was to continue to keep in touch with the guys I’d date, I realized that I didn’t want that for everyone.  There were some creepy guys out there, and I didn’t want to be associated with those kinds of people.  I also felt like John primarily wanted to make out with me again, so I ghosted him quick after that realization.

...

November 24, 2022.  It was Thanksgiving Day, and Thanksgiving break was much needed.  I was starting to feel burned out from school.

I went to David’s relatives’ place in Vineyard.  Again, I didn’t ever feel like I fit the family dynamic.  Since no one seemed interested in talking to me, I left early to go to hang out with Gyuna and Christian.

Even though I still hadn’t seen Connor in person, I still wanted to keep in touch.  He seemed like a nice guy; at least I didn’t get any creepy vibes from him.  It had been a few weeks since I last heard from him, so I texted him happy Thanksgiving.  He asked me how I was, and I told him how it was such a roller coaster with dating.

```Connor:  Haha tell me all about the dates!! I’ve had some interesting experiences too but wanna hear yours!! Have they been good though? What did you do? Who with? What’s interesting about them? How do you feel?```

```Lots of questions haha sorry```

I texted him a long paragraph about Kent and how I was still trying to figure out how to deal with my feelings.  And I asked him if he had ever felt heartbroken too.

```Connor: oh boy I know how you feel. When I first started to date my emotions were all over the place. Do you know the term gay adolescence? Meaning we haven’t had the opportunity to grow and mature with this stuff yet so when we begin to feel these things it’s like we are a young teenager essentially just like you described.```

```I haven’t been “official” with anyone but I basically dated a guy for two months and he didn’t want to be exclusive and I didn’t want to not be so we took a step back and basically had a breakup. It’s been super hard because I really like him and felt like we had a lot going for us. I’ve been heartbroken many times and it sucks. Super not fun thing to go through. I’ve learned it’s just what happens when you date and experience attraction and feelings for other people.```

```So yeah what you’re feeling is normal but not fun. I’m sorry about that :/```

That must have explained why he told me no to a date.  I was surprised that I could at least understand enough to know where he was coming from!  He was probably doing me a service saying no.  Now I understood why Gyuna said I was such a jerk for talking about being heartbroken on my dates.  If Connor were to talk all about his heartbreak about this one guy he still had feelings for, I probably would’ve felt like there was no chance that anything could get more serious.  I still hoped that I could meet Connor in person soon.  It didn’t seem like he wanted to meet in person though.  But I couldn’t tell.  Maybe he wasn’t ready.  But that sounded too optimistic of a view for it to be realistic.

## Section 7

November 27, 2022.  I was at Gyuna’s place again.  Christian was also there.  They were taking a long nap, but that was okay.  I was still texting guys, and a guy named Tate liked me on Hinge.  He was a graduate student at Utah State University, studying computer engineering.  He wanted to video call me, but I told him that I couldn’t since Christian was in the room.  He and I texted for a bit before Gyuna and Christian woke up from their nap, at which point Christian had to leave to go back to Rexburg.

One of Gyuna’s roommates, Aubree, said she was going to a game night with her boyfriend Bryan.  She asked Gyuna and me if we wanted to go.  “I’ve got a lot of homework I need to finish,” Gyuna answered.  “But Michael could go!”

“Are you sure?” I asked.  “You’re just going to do homework by yourself?”

“Yeah.  I haven’t done my homework over break.  Plus, we’ll just talk the whole time, and you’ll distract me.  You can go with Aubree!  She’s super fun.”

Aubree drove me to Bryan’s house.  We attended his ward prayer and played some board games together.

“So how long have you two been dating?” I asked them.

“It’s been about a year or so,” Aubree answered.  She told me about how they met and when they got official.  She also said that she had been dating other guys around before that.  It sounded like my situation.

“When you date multiple people, how do you get serious with one person and stop dating the others?” I asked.

“I think you just start spending more time with that one person, and you eventually stop dating the others.  And it’s good to communicate where you are in dating or a relationship.  That way both of you are on the same page.”

“I don’t date more than one girl at a time,” Bryan said.  “I know the culture here is to date several people, but I grew up in a culture where we date one at a time.”

“Are you dating any girls?” Aubree asked.

“No…” I answered.

In the middle of the game night, I got a text from Tate asking me if I had time to video call him tonight.  I did think he was kinda cute, and he didn’t seem creepy, so I headed to campus after the game night was over to video call him.  I was SO nervous!  I guess it wasn’t a date, but it was definitely the intention, at least for me.

“When did you start dating?” I asked after a bit of conversation.

“I started after I graduated from BYU-I, mostly because I didn’t want the risk of getting kicked out of school,” he answered.  “I tried to be in a relationship with a girl, but let’s just say that it wasn’t even a relationship.  It was pretty crazy.  But I was in a relationship with a guy for three months.  Have you come out to your family?”

“No, none of my family knows.  I’ve only told my best friend, and she’s been very supportive.  What about you?”

“Yeah, I’m out.  I feel like I’m the opposite.  I felt like I had to tell people that I was gay before I started dating guys.  And a few months ago, I felt strongly prompted to come out over social media.  I never thought I’d post something public, but it seemed like the right thing to do.”

After our conversation, I was curious to see what he had posted on his social media, so I may or may not have Facebook stalked him.  I saw a blog post he wrote about his experiences, and it was unbelievably relatable, especially about living in the darkness of denial.  I also found it super attractive that he still went to church and attended activities.  I couldn’t believe there were cute guys like that!  I had texted some guys that said they had left the Church, and it was sad to hear.  Understandable, but still sad.  (I’ll talk more about that in the next chapter.)

I was still skeptical about my feelings though.  I was still trying to get over my feelings for Kent, and I wasn’t sure if a date would’ve happened with Tate anyway.  He lived up in Logan, which was about two and a half hours away from Provo.  And I wasn’t sure how interested he was after video calling me.  Nonetheless, I still thought he had a great [story](https://www.parksnrec.dev/hearts/?fbclid=IwAR3efca_6sGdj0KeCS-B21xz7yT0jOzmkYTztOMUG-1mPONgCNDAdVbMJi8) to share.  (I think it’s great to get more than one person’s perspective on the topics of sexuality and the Church.)

...

November 30, 2022.  I had a first date tonight with a guy named Trevor.  He and I ate at a restaurant called Saida.  He was from a small town in the middle of Utah and worked at a credit union.  "It's been a great place to work,” he said in the middle of our conversation.  “I wouldn't say that I'd want to work there forever, but I've had positive experiences in the workplace.  When I first met my manager, I told her that I was gay.  She reacted so positively to it.  She's my boss, my second mom, and my therapist.  She's worked there for over 30 years, so I guess she has some of her own experiences.  I guess people can have opinions about a working mom when she had young kids, so she could somewhat understand my situation.  She's really strong in the Church, but she’s been so supportive of me.  I even told her that I was going on a date tonight, and she says she wants to hear all about it tomorrow."

I smiled.  “I’ve only come out to my best friend.  It’s been less than a month since I’ve started dating.  I’ve thought a lot about coming out to my family, but it hasn’t felt right.  Have you come out to your family?”

"I told my parents and then eventually my siblings.  My mom—bless her heart.  She cried when I told her.  She didn't cry because I was gay but because I had been holding back and suffering in silence for such a long time."

"Even just six months ago, I thought that I would live a life by myself, and I thought that I'd get my degree, find a job, and find a way to settle and to work every day of my life without much of a life outside of it."

"I’ve had those kinds of thoughts too.  They were definitely a low point in my life.  I don't mean to make our first date somber, but years ago, I got into a really bad car accident, and I wasn't sure if I'd make it.  There was one fatality from that accident.  And after that experience, if I had died, no one would've known me for who I was.  And that was when I knew that I couldn't just keep this part of me to myself.  I needed to let people know."

"I'm honestly not sure how my family would react, especially my parents.  They're not really expressive.  I just remember when my brother was starting college that my parents tried pushing him to start dating, but he wasn't interested at the time.  My parents aren't as pushy with me, but before they left for Guam, they told me that I should take dating classes, which I wasn't interested in at all.  But now I sort of am.  I had a lot of friends who were girls in high school, so they probably thought, 'He'll be fine.'  I guess jokes on them."

Later that night, Trevor texted me saying that it was nice getting to meet me and that he was down to go on another date next week if I wanted.  I didn’t feel anything romantic, but at least he was nice and didn’t seem creepy.  I was still trying to figure things out with my feelings and wondered if going on a second date would change anything.  Plus, he was one of the few guys who had asked me on a date.  I was usually the one who reached out and asked, mostly because I didn’t like texting.  So I said yes to another date.

## Section 8

December 1, 2022.  “Moshi moshi?” I answered my phone.

"Michael!”  It was Gyuna.  “Michael!  I’m broke!”

“Oh.  I’m not surprised.”

“And Christian is broke too!  And I’ve been feeling so lazy and unproductive lately.  Why do I feel like trash?"

"What time did you go to bed last night?"

"Well, I hung out until 3am and then went to sleep."

"Well, that explains it."

"I just need to be like you,” Gyuna said.  “Maybe I need to start eating plain pasta and Jimmy Deanie-ding-dong every day."

"Are you still planning on going to Rexburg?" I asked.  Gyuna told me she was going to see Christian.  It wasn’t surprising.  They had seen each other almost every weekend this semester.  Lately, she had been expressing how attractive Christian was to the point that she thought a bit about marriage.

"Yeah.  I'll be leaving at 1 tomorrow, so I won't be at class,” Gyuna answered.  “And I'll be back Sunday night."

"Wow, I guess we won't see each other until Monday then?  Dang, that's a long time.  It's been a while since we haven't seen each other that long."

"I know, it's crazy.  But I'll see you on Monday for sure."

"I did go on two dates yesterday."

"Wow, Michael!  Before you tell me about them, I want to say that sometimes I do want to call you, but then I remember that you might be on a date with someone, so I don't call."

"It's totally fine.  I don't put my phone on vibrate anyway."

"Dang, your social life is getting better, and every other aspect in your life is basically perfect.  And here I am, feeling like my social life is declining and everything else is so crappy."

I guess I was having a better social life, as in, I was getting to know a bunch of people through dating.  "You know, part of me kind of wishes that I could be in a relationship so I know what it's like," I said.

"There are definitely good things about being in a serious relationship.  I've always been in a serious relationship when I date though.  I think it's good that you get to date different people and get to know them, so enjoy it before you get serious.  I know there are some things that are crappy about casual dating, but I kind of wish I got to date around people.  But hey, I'm so proud of you!  I never knew why pride was such a thing in the LGBTQ community, but now I sort of understand."

"Really?" I was surprised that she would use that word: "proud."  She was proud of me?

"Of course!  It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there like that."

I sighed.  “Dating is so much more complicated than I thought it’d be.”

“But you’re doing SO good!  You’ve been going on all these dates with people.  I don’t get how you’re so good at setting up dates.”

I had stopped texting Kent for about a week, and by the end of it, I felt like my feelings for him were subsiding.  At this point, it had been about two weeks since I first felt heartbroken, and I was feeling a lot better now.  I didn’t think I’d get over him or find anyone like him, but my rationality was coming back, thank goodness.  Maybe I could actually be friends with him and feel that way.

However, I didn’t feel much of a reciprocation.  When I reached back out to him, I asked him about his Thanksgiving.  Earlier, he had told me he was into someone else, and I also asked him if he had gone on his “hot” date.  Maybe that wasn’t the right thing to ask about.

I never heard from him after that.

It hurt to realize that I trusted him when he said he’d support me and that he’d be okay being friends, only to be one of the many people who said a bunch of empty words.  He had told me that he hoped he wouldn’t scare me away from dating, but it looked like I was the one who scared him.  I decided that it was time to move on.  If he didn’t want to put in the effort, that was out of my control.  I was sad because he seemed like he could’ve been a great influence and support to me.  But he was just another Death of a Steppingstone.

I could have stopped dating after this experience and lived like I wasn’t attracted to guys.  Ironically, my desire to date guys increased.  Even though I didn’t have any conversations with Kent after this experience, I saw that he had brought out a side of me that I never knew I had.

My perspective towards people changed.  I used to wonder why it was worth trying to become friends with people when they’d all become Deaths of Steppingstones.  But through my dating experiences and the feelings that came with them—both romantic and unromantic—I saw the value of getting to know people and making connections.

I never fully understood why Adam and Eve were so happy after they partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  They could have lived a life without experiencing sorrow, pain, and death.  They could have lived a life where God was always in their presence.  That kind of life sounded amazing.  But I began to understand why Adam and Eve felt joy.  Even though they would experience those emotions of sorrow, pain, and death, <u>there was joy in experiencing mortality and knowing what emotions were.  There was joy in being able to empathize and have compassion for others.</u>  They were excited to live a life of mortality, even if they were deprived of immortality and living in the presence of God.

An atheist is one who does not believe or even denies the existence of God.  I had never been an atheist of God, but my old self was definitely an atheist of romantic love.  I didn’t believe that what people called “romance” existed or that such emotions came from God.  I even denied that I had these kinds of feelings because growing up, people told me that being gay was bad.  I didn’t think I was a bad person, but having those feelings made me question if I really was a bad person.  If those raw chemicals made me a bad person, then how could a straight person’s raw chemicals be considered good?  I thought that those chemicals were a Disease, whether or not the victim was straight or gay.  I thought that those feelings would magically go away just as magically as the Disease inflicted its victims.  But no, romantic love wasn’t a Disease, and I didn’t think of it as a Disease anymore.  Those feelings were a good thing!

The way I perceived Adam and Eve’s joy and sorrow was the way I felt about the emotions of dating guys.  Sure, it sucked having to go through heartbreak and having to be careful not to end up with creepy guys, but I had never felt so nervous and excited and interested and jealous and all the emotions that came with dating.  I never had those kinds of emotions when I went on dates with girls.  I was taken by surprise when I would ask people about their dating life or when I could relate to someone else’s dating situations.  I could empathize and show compassion.  It clicked for me what Kent meant when he said that he’d rather feel the joy of dating guys and the pain of heartbreak than to feel nothing at all.

<u>Maybe my perspective changed partially because I wasn’t sure if exaltation was a realistic goal for me anymore.  My family too would become Deaths of Steppingstones after this life, but that didn’t mean they weren’t worth being in my life anymore.</u>  From the guys I had dated, many of them loved their families, and their family members loved them too, even if being together in the eternities wasn’t realistic.  Plus, several of the guys I’d date in the future would probably become Deaths of Steppingstones, but it didn’t mean that they wouldn’t add value to my life.

In the past, I had worried a lot about my friendship with Gyuna and how close I was to her.  I knew that she and I probably wouldn’t be in each other’s lives anymore after I’d graduate.  I questioned a lot if I needed to take a step back so that when she’d become a Death of a Steppingstone that it wouldn’t hurt both of us as much.  But that worry stopped.  Gyuna was so supportive of me, and she helped me through thick and thin.  And I hoped I was a good friend to her too.

I honestly couldn’t say that I had met any other guy who had changed me the way Kent did.  I was so excited to see what the future held for me as I continued dating guys.  I knew that I’d go through a roller coaster of emotions, but I’d look back and realize how much joy I had going through those experiences, just like I felt now.

“Heavenly Father, thank you for my experiences with Kent.  Even though I’m sad that things didn’t work out, I’m so grateful that he has changed me for the better.  Please help me to do EVERYTHING I can to cherish and protect this side of me.  In the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.”

And that concludes the story of my first real crush and my first heartbreak ever: Kent.
