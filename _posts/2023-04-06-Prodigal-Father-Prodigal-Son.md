description: An analysis of the emotional relationship between my immediate family members and me
---

_(December 8, 2022; college junior) “So you told me that you haven’t come out to your family, right?” Peter asked._

_“Yeah, just my best friend,” I answered._

_“What makes you hesitant about coming out to your family if you don’t mind me asking?”_

_“I honestly haven’t felt like it’s right to tell them, even though I’ve thought a lot about coming out to them. I think I’d tell my parents first, but I could definitely see my mom telling everyone else in the family, so I feel like it should be no one or everyone when I come out. I should be the one telling that story. Even though it was scary to tell my best friend, I felt like it was right for me to tell her when I did. Plus, my family isn’t really my go-to when I want to talk about concerns or problems.”_

_“How do you think your parents would react if you told them?”_

_“Hm... I don’t know. They’re not very expressive. In the past, I feel like when I’ve gone to them for help with life situations, they don’t seem to care that much unless it affects their reputation. My dad was a stake president when I was in middle school and high school, and he’s a mission president now. Maybe they’ll care because ‘the mission president’s son’ is gay. But I honestly don’t know. I don’t see them kicking me out of the family, but I could see them not caring or not being supportive.”_

## Section 1

September 22, 2023.  Even though I had a full-time job secured, I began to feel depressed thinking about moving to Dallas.  After attending Gather Conference and a few classes of institute, I realized that there was a community of people in Utah who valued both the gospel and their orientation.  It was something I wanted to find ever since I came out to myself.  I wasn’t sure if I was going to find that in Dallas.  There weren’t as many members there, even less so LGBTQ members.

Even though I was going to be moving to Dallas not even a year later, I wanted to find friends and make new connections.  There was value in creating memories with people.  It was also good practice for me in preparation for Dallas, and I knew it was an attribute I wanted in a future husband.

As I interacted with people from institute and felt safe being in that space, I also felt like I didn’t have to hide myself.  They all knew I was gay or at least in the LGBTQ community.  I didn’t realize how much I had suppressed myself growing up until I noticed the difference between being around people who knew I was gay versus those who didn’t know.  It made sense why some people chose to publicly come out on social media.  Putting up a front was exhausting.  But I still didn’t feel safe coming out publicly, especially at BYU.  Telling that to the wrong person could have negative consequences.  Unfortunately, there were some people I interacted with frequently whom I could see treat me differently if they found out I was gay.

Even though I’m not publicly out, having an Asian body was in some ways like being publicly out, especially when trying to adapt to an environment of white people who made up the majority at BYU.  I often felt like because I looked different from everyone else in my ward that I was too different to be associated with.  I didn’t feel integrated in any of my wards during my time at BYU.  Before I acknowledged my orientation, the only reason I came to church (other than it being mandatory to continue attending BYU) was to develop my relationship with God.  It wasn’t until I went to institute this semester when I realized that I had forgotten how friendships in church could help me feel the Spirit more.

...

September 27, 2023.  Sister Okuda video chatted me about something logistical, probably about ordering contact lens solution.  It was going to be just the usual five-minute conversation, but I wanted to know what her thoughts were about my reflection.  Even during the time that she and President Okuda were reading a chapter of my reflection together, she didn’t say anything.

“I feel like she just goes with what my dad says,” I told Gyuna once.  “It’s like she doesn’t have a mind of her own.”

“Allow her to speak in Japanese,” Gyuna suggested.  “It’s usually a lot easier for people to express themselves in their native language.”

When I asked Sister Okuda if she had read my reflection, she said she had read most of it.  I asked what her thoughts were and that she could speak Japanese if it would help her say what she wanted to say.  She spoke in English though.  "Has anything changed between the end of last semester and now?" she asked.

"I want to take things slow," I answered.  "I want to find good friends and good connections."  I talked to her about institute and Gather Conference.

"You said you want to find something long-term, but do you see yourself getting married?"

"Yeah.  I can see it with the right guy."

After some talk, she told me how it was okay to feel a certain way but not to act on it.  She made the analogy that feeling angry didn't justify hitting another person.

"But I don't have a desire to harm someone," I said.  "What about you and Dad?  What makes you think it's okay to act and not just feel?"

She responded saying that the doctrine was marriage between a man and a woman.  I asked her what her thoughts were if God said from the very beginning that marriage should be between a man and a man and a woman and a woman.  It took a few times for her to understand that this was a hypothetical situation because she kept saying that doctrine didn’t change and that such a thing wouldn’t happen.

"I know that doctrine doesn't change and that you think it's doctrine that marriage is between a man and a woman, but this kind of hypothetical situation for you is my reality,” I said.  “I don't think marriage is mechanical.  It's not simply just the ritual of an XX-chromosome being and an XY-chromosome being.  Emotions and feelings are involved too.  I don't see guys and girls blindly marrying each other.  That'd be the quickest way to expedite the process of exaltation."

She and I talked for about an hour.  "You're grown up, and I can't make decisions for you," she said.  "Sometimes some of the things you and Nozomu and Shari do I wouldn't do, but I will support you and be your cheerleader.  I’m most impressed that you still have a testimony of the gospel."

I knew going in that not everything would make sense to her and that I’d have to be patient.  She said she wanted to know more about my dating life, so I took that as a step of progress.

## Section 2

October 3, 2023.  Institute was only during September and November this semester, but Tao and other people in the class still met weekly to eat out.

It was also the week after general conference.  A lot of the people in the group expressed how difficult it was to listen to some of the things said in conference.  I was glad I wasn’t the only one who felt that way.  The two speakers who particularly made conference painful were President Oaks and President Nelson.

President Oaks talked about the three kingdoms of glory, where exaltation—the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom—was the goal.  He explained how marriage between a man and a woman is essential and that The Family Proclamation isn’t merely a “changeable statement of policy.”  He referenced a quote President Nelson gave about how people can choose to live the laws of the celestial, terrestrial, or telestial kingdom and that the plan of salvation “is a plan that completely honors your agency.”  At the same time, President Oaks stated that it “is not enough for anyone to go through the motions” but that we’d be ultimately judged on what we’d become.  He closed his talk by saying that God will force no one into a sealed relationship who is unwilling.

President Nelson’s talk could be summarized in two words: “think celestial.”  He talked about how the choices you make today would determine three things: “where you will live throughout all eternity, the kind of body with which you will be resurrected, and those with whom you will live forever.”  Those who live a celestial law will receive a celestial body.  Those who live a telestial law will receive a telestial body.  He reinforced what President Oaks said about how the sealing and marriage of a man and a woman is the only way that they could be together in the eternities and that covenants “that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise … have an end when men are dead.”

A lot of thoughts were shared among the people at institute.  Someone shared that general conference was for the general public and that specific communities couldn’t always be addressed.  I was a bit skeptical of that reasoning because it almost always felt like prophets and apostles spoke about LGBTQ people, not to them.  Such an idea reinforced that LGBTQ members didn’t belong in the Church and that their circumstances weren’t worth considering.  None of the prophets and apostles were in the LGBTQ community, so it wasn’t like they knew what it was like to be in that situation.  It felt like because things worked out for them, things would work out for us as well.

Another person in the group pointed out how ironic it was that both President Nelson and President Oaks got remarried later in life.  They probably understood the feelings of loneliness and the joy of having a spouse, so why couldn’t they relate their feelings to us?  It was difficult to wrap my mind around how straight people were so privileged that they couldn’t use their experiences to have compassion on us.

BYU’s reason for banning homosexual relationships is that they can’t lead to eternal marriage.  So what if they couldn’t lead to eternal marriage?  A lot of straight couples around the world don’t have any interest in being with their family in the eternities.  LGBTQ people aren’t dumb either.  People don’t get married simply because one person has XX chromosomes and the other person has XY chromosomes.  To ban homosexual relationships because they can’t lead to eternal marriage was a manifestation of black-and-white thinking.

Each person had a reason for hurting, but here’s my perspective on why I felt pain from this past conference: the reminder that exaltation is not a realistic goal and the hopelessness that comes from it.

Growing up, I had been taught that exaltation was the ultimate goal.  It was something I strived for.  We all lived with Heavenly Father, and He created the Earth for us to gain experiences, to become more like Him, and to return to live with Him and our families.  The gospel had steppingstones of covenants for us to return to that destination.  Baptism, receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost, the initiatory, and the endowment were all pretty easy to follow through.

Temple marriage sounded so theoretical before and during my mission.  It seemed like it was just another steppingstone.  Of course I had spiritual experiences associated with making covenants, but temple marriage wasn’t a covenant made just between God and me; it also involved another person.  The reality of the emotional implications of marriage didn’t hit me until after the mission.  It was definitely one of the reasons why I came out.  If I had to hide this part of me for eternity, or even in this life alone, that would’ve been unbearable.

A lot of the guys I went on dates with told me how they tried to date girls but couldn’t follow through.  I knew deep down that I didn’t need to date girls to know that I wasn’t romantically interested in them.  A straight person didn’t need to date someone of the same gender to know that there wasn’t romantic interest.

What if I did try to live the laws of the celestial kingdom by going through the motions and marrying a woman?  It was definitely not a natural desire, much like how a straight person would feel if he were to marry a man.  How would my hypothetical wife feel if I expressed that I married her because I was supposed to marry a woman so that I could receive exaltation?  And how would that sort of relationship develop if children were involved?  I never wanted a woman (or anyone for that matter) to feel like the reason I married her was out of duty and that she was just a means to make ends meet.  I didn’t want to put myself in a situation that wouldn’t make me feel happy either.

Even though getting married to a woman was a steppingstone to exaltation, President Oaks said that it wasn’t enough to go through the motions.  So if marrying a woman wasn’t an option, what then?  I had heard people theorize that everyone would become straight after this life.  Of course straight people would have that perspective because that was how they felt, but the scriptures said that we would carry the desires of the heart with us after this life.  Weren’t romantic feelings one of the desires of the heart?  A change in my orientation sounded wrong and perverted.  Straight people would probably say the same thing if their orientation changed.

In a hypothetical situation, if God created man and woman such that people of the same gender had to marry in order to receive exaltation, would straight people feel hopeful that their sexual orientation would change in the spirit world so that they’d become gay?  I didn’t think so.  Sure, it was a hypothetical situation, but this kind of hypothetical situation was my reality.

Those were the reasons why it hurt listening to President Nelson and President Oaks say that we the use of our agency in this life would determine what kingdom and type of body we’d have, that we should think celestial, that God wouldn’t force anyone into a sealed relationship.  Of course I had a desire to live with God.  Of course I wanted exaltation.  But was exaltation a reality for me?  No, it didn’t seem like it for my situation.  I could use my agency to marry a woman, but that decision was incongruent with my feelings.  It was probably how a straight person would feel having to date and marry someone of the same gender.  So then I would just go through the motions, which was considered “not enough.”  It was as if LGBTQ people were cursed, that we had no hope for the end goal many of us desired.

## Section 3

October 6, 2023.

```President Okuda: Hello, Michael!  How are you doing?  I felt prompted to warn you so you won’t be deceived and do things that bring regrets afterwards.  A verse from the D&C 89 came to me, “In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation”.   Please come to me if you don’t know what to do or need someone to talk to.  You will find safety and enduring happiness in staying on the covenant path.  “Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come”, said Elder Holland.  I testify of what he said is true.```

```Me: What made you feel prompted to share this with me?```

```President Okuda: I was watching news from Japan on a single mother with 3 young children being arrested for a part-time job she found on social media.  She was charged for selling stolen items online.  She did not know that she was engaged in an illegal act.  Somehow, it led me to feel that I need to warn and protect you.```

```Me: What does the story have to do with staying on the covenant path and having certain blessings?```

```President Okuda: So revelation and spiritual promptings can come from an experience we each have.  But sometimes, what we are prompted to do may have little to do with the experience.  For example, I try to take notes while watching General Conference talks.  What I am impressed to write down often has nothing to do with the topic being discussed.  Don’t you have those experiences?```

Of course President Okuda would act like I was socially unintelligent enough to not understand his indirect comments about my orientation and decision to date guys.  I didn’t like how he acted that way.  I got straight to the point.

```Me: Yes, so what are your thoughts about me continuing to date guys?```

```President Okuda: Under “Your body is sacred” chapter of the “For the strength of Youth Guide”, it has this entry: “I am attracted to people of my same sex. How do these standards apply to me? Feeling same-sex attraction is not a sin. If you have these feelings and do not pursue or act on them, you are living Heavenly Father’s sacred law of chastity.”  I think the safety is found in following the counsel on “not pursue or act on them.”   You can and should spend time with boys, like your roommates, Church friends in your ward, classmates, coworkers, etc.  That is very natural and your life will be more fulfilling.```

```Me: What makes you think that the feelings I have for guys aren't worthy to have action but your feelings for women are ok? If the Church didn't say that acting on those feelings is bad, specifically the feelings that I have, would you feel ok about it?```

```President Okuda: It is not okay to act on our base desire regardless of male or female.  In Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness, agency, the power to act for ourselves, is vital.  He loves each and every one of us and desires for us to receive a fullness of joy as He does.   How we use that agency is key to our happiness and the test of our mortality.  As in ancient days, prophets warn us of danger ahead of us and lead us to safety.   Heeding to their counsel brings us closer to our Savior.  https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel?lang=eng```

```Me: So if the Church told you that you shouldn't act on your feelings for women at all, would you?```

```President Okuda: Please study the talk I shared with you.  He testifies of an eternal principle that benefits all of us if it is understood and applied to our own lives.```

I read the talk.

```Me: I think that it is valid for some people to have questions about what the prophets say. There are some things that may be difficult to understand, and I think that's why it's important to ask God about it and receive personal revelation. However, I don't feel that there's much understanding of what the LGBTQ community goes through. A lot of us feel like the prophets talk about us, but not really to us other than when President Ballard said that we need to listen and understand what the LGBTQ community goes through. I think that being straight is a privilege and can be taken for granted because their feelings align with the counsel that the prophets have given. I've prayed and have searched for answers with God about my orientation, and I feel like there's been good fruit that has come from dating guys, like empathy and compassion for those who are dating and in relationships. I think one effect of straight privilege is to disregard questions and situations that would put you in someone's shoes like mine, like the question I asked about how you'd feel if the Church told you that you couldn't act on your feelings for women at all. I genuinely think that the prophets have good intentions when they speak, but they too are imperfect. They don't completely understand what it's like to be in the LGBTQ community, and I think the Church over time has made some progress in its views about those people. But I think that's where personal revelation has been important for me.```

```President Okuda: I agree with your statement about how personal revelation is so important.  I also agree with your statement about your personal growth in empathy and compassion for others.  As you said, no one understands what another person really goes through.  Those who have gone through a similar experience can empathize more and appreciate what others go through.  That’s why Church leaders are not exempted from life-challenges.  In fact, many are acquainted intimately with sorrows and heartaches of life.  Some of the General Authorities whom I became close with have gone through really difficult times in life (e.g., I spent one week with Elder Esplin, the first assignment he had as a General Authority to tour a portion of the Area he is assigned to serve in https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2023/05/new-callings/elder-j-kimo-esplin?lang=eng. In spite of or perhaps precisely because of the tragedies he experienced, he is the most cheerful and down-to-earth person I have met.  He is very friendly and considerate of the needs of others.). That’s why Christ was not spared from all ridicules, being different from others, not being understood, even being betrayed, falsely accused and judged, even forsaken and killed.  In spite of or precisely because of the most difficult life He lived, he is never bitter about His life and He extends his mercy and compassion to all of us because He understands what we go through and comforts us as we go through our own Gethsemane.```

```Me: So far, I do not feel much support or love from you about my decision. I don't think and expect for you to understand exactly what I'm going through. But I think there are a lot of fears and misunderstandings about LGBTQ people that have made several people say and act in ways that aren't Christlike and in some ways are just downright incorrect. Everyone goes through trials. Of course. However, just because everyone goes through trials doesn't mean that we can understand what people go through. As I've talked to others in the LGBTQ community, I think we can agree that we've all felt misunderstood at one point or another.```

President Okuda was sending me links to talks, so in defense, I sent a link of Ben and Charlie’s podcast and talked about who they were.  I specifically shared their most recent episode about the past general conference and how to cope with the hurt.

```President Okuda: Thanks for sharing with me the link.  I admire their courage to share some of their difficult experiences for the benefit of others and try their best to honor the covenants they made with God and keep their faith.  In the “Same-Sex Attraction” page of “Topics and Questions” module in the Gospel Library, it says,```

```“Same-sex attraction refers to emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to a person of the same gender. The experience of same-sex attraction is not the same for everyone. Some people may feel exclusively attracted to the same gender, while others may feel attracted to both genders.```

```“The Church distinguishes between same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior. People who experience same-sex attraction or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual can make and keep covenants with God and fully and worthily participate in the Church. Identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual or experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin and does not prohibit one from participating in the Church, holding callings, or attending the temple.”```

```There is safety and abundant blessing in making covenants with God and trying our best to keep and uphold our covenants.```

He was just repeating a bunch of stuff that I knew and that brought me pain.  It was apparent that he wasn’t in a position to listen.

```Me: I can sort of understand that as a mission president, there isn't much flexibility in being open to different perspectives since you kinda have to follow what your leaders say, but the reason I keep my covenants isn't simply because someone tells me to. I've had experiences with keeping my covenants that have been good, even if it isn't always easy.```

```Again, I think it's easy for straight people to take for granted their sexuality. I think it's easy for you to say to go through the motions of keeping covenants since your feelings align naturally with dating and marriage. I hope you'll have more compassion with people who are in my situation. It is not so black and white for us.```

```President Okuda: “I’ve had experiences with keeping my covenants that have been good, even if it isn’t always easy.”  Thumbs Up!```

He probably didn’t realize that it was people like him who didn’t have an open mind and heart that made it difficult to keep to the faith.

```Me: And what you consider to not be keeping my covenants with dating guys has also been good. I've had spiritual experiences and insights from them too.```

I knew that it would take patience and time for my family members to come to terms with my sexual orientation, but the way that President Okuda reacted to the thoughts I shared not only of this conversation but also about reading “Harry Potter” and to says something as childlike as “guys don’t get to know each other through dating apps” made me feel absolutely hurt and livid.

_(August 2023; college senior) In theory, most of my family members gave supporting words, but in reality, would they want to listen to me and want to learn more about my dating life?  Maybe the real question was if I would feel comfortable talking about my dating life with them.  I wasn’t sure what I could do to reassure myself that they were supportive of me._

I needed to talk to someone about how I felt with President Okuda’s reaction to my reflection.  My go-to was usually Gyuna, but she was so unavailable these days.  When I tried to invite her to do things, she either didn’t respond or said she was too busy.  I decided to not bother her after several invitations.

I also thought about Shari.  She knew both President Okuda and me, so I felt like she would be more understanding of the context.  There was still part of me that felt skeptical of trust.  I rarely ever went to my family when I had emotional concerns, but I wanted to give Shari an opportunity to see what she meant when she said she wanted to support me.

I hesitantly messaged Shari and asked if I could stop by to talk to her about President Okuda’s words.  She responded enthusiastically saying I could come over, so she and I set up a time.

## Section 4

October 7, 2023.  I went to Shari’s place and hung out with my 10-month-old nephew Kiyoshi for the first bit.  I tried to figure out how I could talk about President Okuda, but it felt so unnatural to bring up the subject to someone outside of my friends.

“So have you been on any dates this semester?” Shari then asked.

"I haven't," I answered.

"It sounds like you really are taking a break."

"I want to find good connections.”  I told her about the people at institute.  “They'll do stuff like getting ice cream or going to Taco Tuesdays at Don Joaquin, so I go to those.  I still don't feel very connected with them, but I'm trying to find friends there."

"Have you talked to our parents recently?"

"I have. I had a video call with Mom recently. She told me that while she might do things differently, she can't make decisions for me and that I'm the one to make decisions. She said she wants the best for me and wants to be my cheerleader."

Shari smiled. "She's changed a lot. I'm happy to hear that."

"I know I told you about how Dad told me that he thinks I'm in this social phase of getting to know guys. But yesterday, he texted me saying that he felt prompted to warn me not to be deceived by differing voices, and I felt like he was alluding to my decision to date guys. I asked him directly about it. I didn't feel any sort of love or support from him. He was just really preachy and sent me talks to read. He makes it sound like dating guys is evil and that I'm straying away."

During the conversation, Shari shared her feelings and relationship with President and Sister Okuda.  “I was a lot closer to Dad when I was young, but I know what you mean,” she continued.  “I don't know if it's just because he's in a mission president role and that he's in teaching mode, but he sometimes does come off as preachy. I also don't think our parents have much experience with people in the LGBTQ community."

"Do you know much about the LGBTQ community?" I asked.

"No, not really."

"What is it that makes you supportive of me? I feel like the Church teaches and says a lot of things about the LGBTQ community that are very negative."

"I think that's what the difference is; I don't completely agree with everything the Church says about how there's only one way to be happy or that homosexuality is evil and that you'll be damned and condemned and not worthy of exaltation. I don't believe that God created us so that some of us are inferior to others.

“Growing up, I was very gung-ho about the Church. I think with our home being a mix of Japanese culture and the culture of the Church, we put everything in a box and thought that everything had to be a certain way. That destroys our agency, our ability to choose. That’s what life is all about. I think Heavenly Father gave us agency because we can learn and grow from making our own choices. When I was out of the house, it was difficult to let go of my parents' views and to be able to think for myself.

“I remember when I was a youth, someone's child died, and I sent an email to the parent saying, 'You should meet with the missionaries.' I absolutely can't believe how uncompassionate I was, especially since they have their own Christian faith. I didn't actually try to sympathize with how they felt or what they were going through.

“People in the Church say that they're accepting of others. They're not. In this last conference when President Nelson said to not listen to the unbelievers, I thought about if Kiyoshi were a youth and he took that to heart. With David's decision to leave the Church, would we have a family where we can learn to love and listen to each other and respect each other’s differences, or would we have a rift within our family to not listen to the unbelievers?

“As I read your reflection, your liking guys was something that you knew very well about yourself. It's not just a teenage phase of like, 'Maybe I like guys, maybe I like girls.' I think some guidance is appropriate in those kinds of situations. But you've learned and you've grown from your experiences with dating guys. I can tell that you want to get to know others and develop an actual relationship with someone, and I think you're capable of being a good husband and father like any other good person.” She told me about an extended family’s situation of a parent leaving the family because she couldn’t put up a wall anymore.  “Not that mixed-orientation marriages can't work, but thinking that marrying someone of the opposite sex is the only way that a marriage can work isn't how it is for everyone. So to answer your question, as I've become more open to other people's perspectives, I've come to see that there isn't just one way for every single person to be happy."

After some conversation, I felt more at ease.  I was super grateful that I had talked to Shari.  I couldn’t remember the last time I had a deep conversation like this with her.  I knew she would be safe to talk to.

...

In Luke 15, we read the parable of the prodigal son.  According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “prodigal” is “characterized by profuse or wasteful expenditure; lavish.”  The son chose to leave his family and waste his inheritance.

President Okuda is a convert.  He joined the Church in Japan when he was 17.  His mother, who practiced Buddhism, wasn’t happy when he met with the missionaries.  When President Okuda told the whole family about being mission president two years ago, he said that his mother wasn’t happy that he was going to put a pin in his career for something she didn’t see worthy enough.  “Maybe if I was going to become a Buddhist priest, she would’ve been okay with it,” he said.

Only about 1 percent of people in Japan practice Christianity.  The majority practice either Shinto or Buddhism.  I could see President Okuda’s mother asking, “Why is my son straying from the ways of Buddhism and practicing a strange, Western religion?”

President Okuda shared stories of spiritual experiences that taught him about Christ and the gospel.  I could relate to his stories because of how the gospel was substantially and positively influential in my life.  Expressing the feelings that come from those experiences can be difficult to describe in words, especially to someone who doesn’t know anything about the gospel or a concept of God.  As a new “pioneer” in the faith, 17-year-old President Okuda probably couldn’t convey to his mother why he was choosing to join the Church, no matter how eloquent the description of his feelings and experiences.  He knew what he was taught was true, and he couldn’t deny it.  Even though none of his family members joined the Church, he acted in faith.

So in what way is President Okuda a “prodigal” son?  He chose to lavishly spend his life living the gospel, even though his mother wanted him to practice the ways of Buddhism.  During the time the prodigal son was away from home, I wonder what thoughts and feelings the father had.  “Will he come back home?” or “I’m not worried.  He’ll realize his poor decisions and come back.”  Similarly, I wonder if President Okuda’s mom thought, “Will he come back to the ways of Buddhism?” or “I’m not worried.  He’ll realize his poor decision to join the strange Christian faith and will practice Buddhism again.”

In parallel, my feelings and experiences of my orientation are difficult to explain.  It’s apparent that no matter how much I try to describe them, many straight people don’t seem to understand, even though I feel like straight people and LGBTQ people have so much in common in terms of romantic connection.  I prayed a lot to God about this side of me, and I acted in faith to know if dating guys was a right or wrong decision.  As a “pioneer” being a gay man in the Church, and only having been out to myself for less than a year, it was difficult to describe the emotional and spiritual experiences I had from dating guys.  I felt like people thought that same-sex dating meant that they couldn’t have any good association with the Church.

I was a “prodigal” son where I chose to lavishly acknowledge my orientation and do something about those feelings, even when people in the Church judged and pointed fingers.  Maybe President Okuda was like his mother.  Maybe he thought, “Will he come back to the ways of heterosexuality and marry a woman?” or “I’m not worried.  He’ll realize that his feelings are a phase and will marry a woman.”

I found it ironic that President Okuda didn’t empathize with me.

A few days after the exchange with President Okuda, he messaged me:

```President Okuda: I love you!```

I was insulted.

```Me: Why? Merely because the Church commands you to love your children? Or because you actually care about me regardless of what people say or my circumstances? Cuz I feel like it’s more of the former.```

```President Okuda: I just had that feeling come to me.```

Telling me that I was loved didn’t make me feel any better about my relationship with President Okuda nor was it an apology for the way he reacted.  I didn’t want an apology until he knew why his words were hurtful.  This situation was just another piece of evidence why I didn’t like being emotionally vulnerable around my family.  It confirmed to me that it really was better to hide myself growing up.

Maybe I agreed with one of Nozomu’s perceptions of people: President Okuda was like a CEO.  I thought he’d care to know more about my life, not merely because I had the title of “son”—merely the result of his contribution of sperm to produce offspring—but because of the emotions he had for raising, nurturing, and teaching me.  Maybe that wasn’t the case if he viewed my writing was just “Harry Potter.”  He didn’t ever have to know about this side of me.  I took that risk of being vulnerable in hopes of strengthening my relationship with my family.

But yes, I did agree with Nozomu.  President Okuda was CEO first, father second.
