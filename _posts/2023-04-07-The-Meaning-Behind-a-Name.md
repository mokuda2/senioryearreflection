```My mom told me every day to always be careful of guys```

```Because love is like playing with fire. It can get you hurt, eh.```

```My mom might be right because when I see you, my heart fires up.```

```My attraction towards you is greater than the fear, eh.```

.

```I can't stop this trembling, on and on and on.```

```I wanna throw my all into your world.```

```Look at me, look at me now.```

```Look at how you’re making me nervous.```

```I can't stop it.```

```Our love is like playing with fire.```

.

(Chorus)

```My love is on fire.```

```Now burn, baby, burn.```

```Playing with fire.```

```My love is on fire.```

```So don't play with me, boy.```

```Playing with fire.```

.

```Oh no, I've already come too far.```

```Suddenly, none of this is a game anymore.```

```Love is like a spark of fire.```

```Let the wind blow. The fire will grow.```

```Even my mom doesn’t know if this is medicine or poison.```

```He stole my heart. (But where are the cops?)```

```You’re like the oil poured onto my burning heart.```

```Kiss him, will I diss him? I don't know, but I miss him.```

```This love that goes beyond addiction is crack.```

```The color of my heart is black.```

.

```I can't stop this trembling, on and on and on.```

```I wanna throw my all into your fire.```

```Look at me, look at me now.```

```Look at how you’re making me nervous.```

```I can't stop it.```

```Our love is like playing with fire.```

.

(Chorus)

```My love is on fire.```

```Now burn, baby, burn.```

```Playing with fire.```

```My love is on fire.```

```So don't play with me, boy.```

```Playing with fire.```

.

```It's raging out of control.```

```The fire is spreading too fast.```

```Don't stop me.```

```Let this love burn the night away.```
