I normally write my reflections via Word, but a "blog" website looks and functions a lot more nicely.  There are a few links to music videos and other media that make them more accessible on a website.  They're completely optional to understand my reflection, but I feel like they help set the mood.  Music and other people's perspectives convey things that I can't in my own words.  They'll also all be at the very end of my reflection.

My reflection's audience is primarily my family, so I've kept them in mind as I've written this.

_Passages in italics are flashbacks of the past._  They typically are copy-and-paste passages from previous reflections, but I've also written some flashbacks to parts of my mission.  The first chapter has a lot of flashback reading to help build context for the rest of my reflection.  The first two chapters may seem a bit slow and a little all over the place, but I promise that I've made sure that everything I wrote is relevant by the end of the reflection.

<u>I underline passages of my reflection that I feel are extremely important and relevant for understanding later parts of my reflection.</u>  Hopefully those passages will help guide you in understanding what I feel is the purpose of this reflection.

<span style="color:red">Words or phrases in red are important concepts or people to keep in mind while reading.</span>  I hope this will also help with relevance and purpose of my reflection.

I hope you enjoy reading my reflection as much as I've enjoyed putting it together!
