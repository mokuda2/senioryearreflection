description: My love-hate relationship towards the BYU community and the gay community
---

<!--Note: This chapter is very theoretical and won't contain much story.  I express some of my perspectives that may be uncomfortable and emotionally charging towards the BYU community and the gay community.  This chapter contains some of my personal battles and struggles, so I hope that readers keep that context in mind and create space to be open to perspectives they've not considered before.  In an episode from Questions from the Closet, Ben, Charlie, and Aliah do an amazing job at explaining [what minority stress is](https://questionsfromthecloset.com/episode/?s=4&e=7) and how it affects minority groups' thoughts and behavior, which will be what most of this chapter will be about.

## Section 1

Dating life this semester was pretty mundane.  I was using dating apps but mostly to find friends.  By the end of the semester, I figured that dating apps weren’t tools for finding friends.  Obviously.  But I didn’t like how after one date, I’d never see the guy again, even if I left on good terms.  I wanted to meet and hang out with people like I did at institute.

I watched a few episodes of Parks and Rec on a few different occasions with one guy.  I went on a few “dates” with another guy who was completely new to dating.  There was another guy I went on “dates” with for about a month.  They all seemed more interested in me than I wanted them to be, so none of them became my friends.  Thankfully, dating life wasn’t as emotional of a roller coaster as last school year.

[//]: # (I had four categories or "evaluation criteria" I used to evaluate how interested I was in pursuing something further when dating a guy.  From greatest importance to least, I evaluated character, looks, personality, and interests.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (First, character.  I think about Christlike attributes when it comes to a person's character.  Developing one's character is something everyone has control over.  Anyone could be respectful.  Anyone could be patient.  It comes down to how one is developing those attributes and which attributes he values most.  I also consider intelligence to be part of character.  How does he develop and use his academic, social, and emotional intelligence?  What goals does he have?  Character isn't something I find in someone immediately on the first or second date.  I think a true person's character shows when the "impressing the other person" stage dies down.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Second, looks.  I think straight guys and gay guys share common ground where appearance is an important factor in finding a partner.  If I had to date a girl, I'd tell her straight up that I'm dating her for her personality and not her looks.  In photos or videos of couples, I always look at the guy.  I don't care about the girl's appearance.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Third, personality.  I see this as more of the innate or unique part of a person.  One person can be loud and another person can be reserved, but both can express respect or kindness in their own ways.  That's how I differentiate personality from character.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Fourth, interests.  Commonality in interests isn't something I value as much as I value how well a guy communicates or treats other people, but similar interests can be a great way to connect.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (At least for the moment, dating life was pretty bland.  I really just wanted to find good friends and influences.)

I often thought back to Gather Conference when some theorized that heaven wouldn’t be a sad place.  Exaltation only took place in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom.  But what would it look like for a family to be in the same kingdom of glory and not be together in the eternities?

People don’t live the gospel of Jesus Christ simply because they have a goal to return to Heavenly Father and live with their families forever.  Those are the outcomes.  People live the gospel of Jesus Christ because they feel happy with that lifestyle.  It gives them hope for things in this life because of the knowledge of what will happen after this life.

When LGBTQ members are specifically targeted and told that they need to live the gospel as if they’re not, being around those kinds of people doesn’t feel safe or comforting.  It must have been more difficult for people who are publicly out.  For LGBTQ members, attending church didn’t make them feel happy when they were judged or marginalized.  Even though gospel principles and a relationship with God could be practiced independent of others, LGBTQ members often felt unsafe, isolated, and misunderstood by people in the Church.

Could a gay person and a homophobic person dwell in the celestial kingdom together?  Would they want to be around each other?  Even if a gay man in a mixed-orientation marriage like Brother Barrow kept his covenants in this life, would he want to dwell in the celestial kingdom?  Brother Barrow said he sometimes faced discrimination from parents who were skeptical that a gay man was teaching seminary.  Being in a heaven with people like that sounded like hell.

Even outside the scope of LGBTQ, is it possible for people to reside in the celestial kingdom when there are so many differences in culture, even throughout time in the same country?  Would there be any chance for a white American man in the 1800s to accept that black people are just as valuable as himself, even when society for many generations saw black people as property?

Sometimes I feel like the celestial kingdom is very idealized in some people’s heads.  When I was young, I thought that being exalted was a happy, blissful time to be with my family and other people and that we’d all get along with each other.  When I began dating guys, I wasn’t sure if exaltation was realistic anymore, but now I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be with my family, at least with President Okuda and his reaction towards my orientation.  I felt a bit worried for the missionaries there who might be secretly denying their feelings like I did on my mission.

From the perspective of a gay man, homophobic people shouldn’t dwell in the celestial kingdom.  But what about the prophets and apostles who have said homophobic things or have enforced homophobic policies like how children of gay parents couldn’t get baptized?  From the power of the apostles and prophets, they would likely dwell in the celestial kingdom.  It seemed like those in the LGBTQ community were viewed to have bodies that were less than celestial.

I hear people wonder why race is such a big deal.  So what if that person is black or Asian or white?  What’s the big deal about diversity?  In theory, it would’ve been nice if race didn’t affect people’s perceptions, but in reality, it’s a huge factor that in the way people treat each other, even subconsciously.

The state of the soul for LGBTQ people seemed quite similar to the state of the soul for black people when they couldn’t receive the priesthood or participate in temple covenants.  It must have been difficult being a black person in the 1950s.  When would a black child become aware of being in a community that was treated less?

I also wondered what it would’ve been like being a white person in the 1950s. At least from what I had learned in school, black people certainly were not as well-educated; black schools were not as well-funded as white schools. And due to lack of education, there were probably less opportunities for what jobs black people were able to pursue. They probably received only the minimum. They were of poor socioeconomic status, and that cycle continued as those black people raised families of their own. It was just a feedback loop that continually put them at a disadvantage.

For a white child to grow up in a society where being white was a privilege and part of the majority, no wonder they would’ve seen black people as inferior. White people had better education, more job opportunities, and better-paying jobs. That was the society they and many generations before them lived in. It wasn’t like black people could do anything to easily convince white people that black people were just as worthy of rights and opportunities when the way that white people saw the world was painted with privilege.

I also wondered what it would have been like being a black member and a white member in the 1950s. Black people couldn’t go through the temple or receive the priesthood during that time, which also implied that they couldn’t receive exaltation. Of course, it’s easy to look back in retrospect and say that anyone can enjoy the blessings of the priesthood now, but how did black members back then keep to the faith? It must have been pretty normal to receive discouraging news like that living in a society where they were treated poorly anyway.

Black people not receiving the priesthood implied more than just not receiving exaltation.  They were certainly viewed as undesirable.  White members who had hopes for exaltation couldn’t marry a black person.  The way that sealings couldn’t be done if a black person were involved might be the way some members of the Church view same-sex marriage. On top of not being able to make temple covenants, the poor socioeconomic and low educational backgrounds of black people probably made them even less desirable.  With such perceptions, black bodies were probably equivalently viewed as telestial bodies.  If members of the Church back then were to take President Nelson's invitation to "think celestial," what was the point of marrying a black person or even thinking that a black person was desirable if the marriage couldn’t last into the eternities?  Someone who wanted a celestial body didn’t want a telestial one.

Support from outside a minority community is crucial for change.  It was obviously so for LGBTQ people’s journeys, which was why allies were so crucial.  While people in the LGBTQ community can share their stories and experiences all they want, their voices are in vain if people in the majority don’t do anything about it.

It was like blacks and the priesthood.  Black people could be baptized and help build temples all they wanted, but it was only the prophet—a non-black person—who could make changes to who could and could not receive the priesthood.  I saw why allies were so important.  They were like the bridge that connected the LGBTQ community to those who were not familiar or were not supportive of the community.  Sharing the perspectives of LGBTQ people could make a positive difference for people outside the community.

Section 2

November 16, 2023.  Even though Sister Okuda said she was interested in knowing more about my dating life, I didn’t feel like she actually was.  She had called about something, probably about ordering contact lens solution, but after finalizing the details for that, I decided to be a bit more vulnerable and talked to her about my friends from institute and some of the dates I had been on.  After I finished, she said something about the contact lens solution.  I could tell she wasn’t sure how to respond.  Maybe talking to her about my dating life wasn’t going to be great after all.

As far as hanging out with people at institute, Tao said he was open to have a talk with anyone after the discussion about general conference.  I decided to take that opportunity to get to know him better and messaged him, and he said he was down to meet one-on-one.  I suggested we could eat somewhere, remembering that he said he didn’t like sushi.  It was somewhat relatable; it wasn’t like sushi was a top pick for me.  We ended up going to Café Rio.

It was cool to hear Tao’s story, and I also got to share mine.  The different ways that our family members reacted were pretty similar, where some were supportive and others not so much.  Tao and I were able to get to know each other a lot better since the only times we hung out were with the rest of the institute people.  Everyone loved Tao, including me.  He was probably the most inclusive person I knew and was the glue who held the group together.  The group of us did a lot of activities together outside of Taco Tuesdays at Don Joaquin: karaoke and cookie taste testing, making friendship bracelets while listening to Taylor Swift’s new album, and an upcoming Friendsgiving party.  I felt like after getting to know Tao better, I felt a lot more comfortable being in the group.

...

Finding a community where one feels loved and belonged is a part of human nature and desire.  Communities are an economical way for people to connect due to common ground.  Why is it important for people to gather and connect?  It gives them opportunities to listen and have compassion for others who not only have similar experiences and perspectives but also different ones, knowing that common ground shared is what holds them together.  I don’t believe that the celestial kingdom is going to be a siloed place where each family is in a separate group from the rest.

Unfortunately, differences often divide people.  When people are treated poorly or disagreements arise, people often create boundaries to divide off from the offenders or those they perceive to be offenders.  While boundaries can be good, creating them based off of stereotypes isn’t always healthy.

One example of creating boundaries was when Gyuna told me not to associate with people who treated me differently because of my race, reasoning that being around those kinds of people was toxic.  It’s true; being around those kinds of people is toxic.  But a consequence of avoiding them is that they don’t get opportunities to get to know those kinds of people, which is what can help bridge understanding.  Another consequence is that due to the optimization that stereotyping provides, people who look or act in certain ways may be stereotyped to judge me for my race, which can lead me to push certain people out who dare to cross the boundary.  Pushing people out on either side widens the gap between the boundary and how willing people in the community are willing to step close to that boundary.  I call this the widening gap effect.

Another example of a widening gap effect is from [a study BYU conducted on BIPOC students](https://race.byu.edu/00000177-d543-dfa9-a7ff-d5cfc1dc0000/race-equity-belonging-report-feb-25-2021), who shared their experiences and feelings they had while attending BYU.  There’s already a huge percentage gap between white and BIPOC student populations, but BIPOC students’ experiences of isolation led many of them to tell their siblings and friends not to apply to BYU.  From the three-year analysis of freshman applicants, BIPOC applicants successively decreased, widening the gap between white and BIPOC student populations, leading to more isolation among BIPOC students.  The negative cycle continues until something is done about it.

About 80 percent of BYU students are white.  In a theoretical situation, if all students were put into a bucket and were drawn out in groups of five where each person is equally likely to be drawn, it’s likely that four of them would be white and one of them wouldn’t be white.  In reality, groups of people at BYU aren’t like that.

It was interesting to observe white people interacting with other white people.  When there was someone new in the group who was white, it was pretty typical for the people in the group to introduce themselves to the new person.  I definitely didn’t feel that way when I hung out with new groups of people, especially white people.  Asians tended to hang out with other Asians, and so did black people with other black people.  In the theoretical situation, the probability of pulling out five Asians in a row was very slim.  But humans are more complex than theoretical experiments.  I didn’t think it was just mere coincidence that people tended to group themselves the way they did.  The optimization of stereotyping played a huge role in group formation.

I think about the Asian wards at BYU.  I’ve been to one of them a few times, and there’s a surprising number of Asian Americans.  I can understand how international students can find connection and community amongst each other with cultural similarities, but I wasn’t sure about why Asian Americans rather attended the Asian ward than their local wards.  Even though culture within the home could’ve been a factor, many of them sounded and acted like Americans because they grew up in the US.  From my experiences of being Asian at BYU, I inferred that they probably had similar experiences where they didn’t feel like they belonged in their local wards or among groups of white people.  It was simply because of Asians’ appearances that made them feel disconnected in their local wards and more approachable in an Asian ward.  It was pretty messed up.  In one Sunday school class, the teacher shared his story about coming to Utah, which was something along the lines of, “I asked God where I should go, and He said Utah.  And at first, I was like, ‘Why Utah out of all places?  I’m Asian.’”  I was sure several Asians could relate to that.

I felt like most of the “allies” of the Asian community at BYU were returned missionaries who had served in Asian countries.  I’ve attended the Japanese club and the badminton club a few times, and I was surprised when white people approached me and other Asians.  They learned the language and the culture and saw Asians as more than computer geeks or anime nerds.  That was definitely a Western stereotype.

I feel like one of the biggest hurdles of any community in overcoming stereotypes is the fear of perception from their friends or their community.  For example, I can see how a stereotypical jock guy who tries to be friends with an Asian man might think, “What if people in my jock community think I’m an anime geek?” or “I don’t want people to think I’m associated with a race that’s considered undesirable and lower my reputation.”  Or a straight guy who has a gay friend: “What if people think I’m dating this guy?” or “People will look down on me because I’m associating with a gay man.” or “What if people think my gay friend is going to turn me gay and that I support the gay agenda?”  People don’t want to be perceived as peculiar by their own communities.

The term “peculiar” is used to describe the Israelites since they were considered to be valued treasure selected by God.  Members of the Church also often refer to themselves collectively as “peculiar.”  In some ways, the world did consider members of the Church to believe and practice peculiar or unusual teachings, such as abstaining from coffee.  At least within BYU culture, however, one couldn’t be TOO peculiar, like being LGBTQ.  At BYU, being too peculiar for being gay was a similar feeling to the way I felt too peculiar because I was Asian.  The Church says they’re accepting of everyone, but in reality, are they?  No.  For someone as socially charismatic as Gyuna to say that she felt alien and different at BYU was a sign that it wasn’t just a “me” problem.

The gay community was pretty similar.  Many people view such an orientation as peculiar, but gay people can relate to each other through similar experiences.  However, just because someone is gay doesn’t necessarily mean he’d be accepted by the community.  The standard for general acceptance was to be fit, masculine, and white.  Because I was an Asian man—stereotyped to be small, effeminate, and lacking westernized features—I was too peculiar to be accepted, especially by those who met the standards.  To translate from gay jargon to LDS jargon, having an Asian body was analogous to having a telestial body.  It was less desirable than having a celestial body.  People in the gay community argue that they should be accepted for who they are, yet they accept only certain people in their community.  I hated the hypocrisy.  It was why I didn’t feel like I belonged in the gay community, and it was why I was hesitant when it came to being an advocate for the community.

"I have a question, and I feel like I know what your response will be," I said to Gyuna.  She and I had gotten out of a rehearsal for a Korean festival performance.

She sighed.  "Okay, go for it."

"What are your thoughts on a nose job?"

"Michael!  You dumbass!  Why?!  Your nose is in harmony with your face.  Literally everything about your face is in harmony other than your eyes now.  I liked your eyes before you had surgery, but the only reason why I was okay with the surgery is that it's the least risky operation."  She shook her head and sighed again.  “Michael, I don’t have romantic feelings for you, but you are a handsome guy.”

I was surprised she said that.  I was surprised someone said anything like that to me.

“You’re handsome!” she repeated.

“You’re biased,” I responded.

“I’m not.”

“You know me more than just my appearance.”

She and I talked for a bit before she called Christian in hopes to get validation that a rhinoplasty was unnecessary.

"Did you know that I want to fix the bump on my nose?" Christian asked me.

"Yeah, I told him about it," Gyuna said.

"I don't think you need more than two plastic surgeries," Christian said, implying that getting a nose job was okay.

“Christian only cares about himself,” Gyuna retorted.  “I care about you, Michael.”

If Sam Smith University were a hypothetical school where the majority were gay men like it was with LDS people at BYU, Asian men would probably still be treated as alien and undesirable.  In other words, gather enough gay people as a society, and they’d marginalize people too.  It didn’t matter what community was considered a majority.  Minorities too could act like marginalizing majorities.  The gay community and the BYU community are strikingly similar in that respect.

Thoughts about plastic surgery came from trying to fit in and find acceptance from both communities.  There was one question that often came to mind before my operation: if I get plastic surgery, how would I perceive those in the Asian community who don't have double eyelids?  Would I look down upon them?  If I said yes, then I would be guilty of what the BYU community and the gay community do to those who are perceived as less than the standard.  If I said no, then why did I want to get plastic surgery in the first place?  Why couldn't I be happy with my Asian-looking monolids?

Part of the coping mechanism of being a minority and trying to fit in with the majority was being exceptional.  Plastic surgery was a physical way of looking exceptional.  Looking back, I noticed in high school how respected I was because of my reputation for being the smartest in my grade, being above-average at the piano, being a class officer, and being "the stake president's son."  People respected me and were a lot more approachable.  When I came to BYU, I definitely wasn't the smartest kid or the most talented.  President Okuda had no direct connection to the students at BYU.  With the disadvantage of looking different from the majority, I felt like people didn't respect me as much as when I was in high school, and I felt pressure that in order to be accepted, I had to go above and beyond.

In the episode with Ben, Charlie, and Aliah, they talked about how they felt pressure from being in a minority group.  Being gay in the LDS community, Charlie talked about how having a temple recommend was a bigger deal because most people in the Church assumed that someone who was gay wasn't worthy.  There was this pressure that in order to be accepted as a gay latter-day saint, one had to have a temple recommend or serve in the temple x number of times a week or whatever other thing to be exceptional.  When he was in the closet in high school, he felt pressure to "compensate" for his feelings by being exceptional at school and being part of several leadership positions for extracurricular activities.  That way if someone were to call him out as gay, all of his accomplishments and titles wouldn't easily change other people's perceptions of him.  I felt similarly about being Asian at BYU.  I was involved in two club leaderships, was a research assistant, was pursuing two minors in mathematics and computer science, participated in two hackathons by invitation, completed three internships, the list could go on.  Of course, I joined leadership partly because I wanted to help the clubs and develop my leadership skills, but I also joined leadership partly so that I could fit in and have an easier time connecting with people due to my status.

I felt like the stereotypes of Asian men from the perspective of people in the gay community came from media much like any other community.  Stereotypes were so powerful sometimes.  For example, I met many people on my mission who made assumptions about the LDS community that were often skewed or expressed in a negative manner.  They often got their sources from media outside the Church and didn’t ask members of the Church about their experiences.  Even when I tried to correct them, they insisted that what they had read or seen was fact.  Similarly, I felt like people in the gay community were so fixed in their mindset of what an Asian man was supposed to look like that even if they saw a tall, muscular Asian man, he'd still be undesirable because he was stereotyped to be what an Asian man is supposed to look like.

There was another aspect that made LGBTQ-related concerns more complex where media was a strong influence: politics.  In the US, a lot of people are passionate about their political label.  From the perspective of someone who didn’t grow up being educated in American politics, I observed that there are two big parties that are often polarizing.  One side calls themselves Democrats or liberals.  The other side calls themselves Republicans or conservatives.  What I never understood was why people used their labels as an influence on their opinions.

I heard many liberals talk about how conservatives try to pass anti-LGBTQ laws or how conservatives talk about how liberals are trying to force schools to teach children about the gay agenda.  So what if people consider themselves conservative or liberal?  LGBTQ issues are more than just a US issue.  LGBTQ discrimination was wrong no matter what part of the world someone was in.  If all gay people were stereotyped to be liberal and all anti-LGBTQ to be conservative, then “liberals” are just as guilty for being discriminatory towards people like me for being Asian.

Section 3

January 1, 2024.  I spent Christmas break in Connecticut with Nozomu and Deanna.  They had a daughter who was almost three months old, so that was the first time I saw my niece.  They played Japanese nursery songs and read Japanese baby books to her, which I approved.

“You don’t have to answer this question if you don’t want to, but do you have a secret boyfriend?” Deanna asked.

“I don’t,” I answered.  “I focused more on trying to make friends than going on dates.  Nothing looked promising with the guys I did go on dates with, so I don’t think anything serious is going to happen next semester.  It’ll be my last semester too.”

“I feel like out of all of us in the Okuda family, you definitely got the BYU dating experience.”

“Me?  The BYU dating experience?  I think my experience has been pretty different.”

“You went on lots of dates.  I certainly didn’t have that kind of experience.”  She continued.  “I hope you know that this is a safe space to talk about your dating life.  I know BYU can be very isolating in that respect.  My dad has a brother and a sister who are gay.”  I wondered if she knew that Nozomu told me he wasn’t supportive of my decision to date guys.  I also wondered how Nozomu reacted when he found out that Deanna had gay relatives.  It seemed like he was okay with it since he said positive things about Deanna’s uncle and his husband.  Nozomu also showed me a cookbook they bought written by a gay person.

“Shari told me about your relatives,” I responded.  “I didn’t know.  Was that tough for your dad?”

“No, it was just a normal part of their lives.  When my dad married my mom, my dad's parents were like, 'He's straight?!'  So I've also grown up with relatives who are gay, and it’s normal for me.  They’re part of our family.”

Even though I still didn’t feel Nozomu’s support, I felt that Deanna was another safe person.  Anytime she talked about my hypothetical future or relationships, she never made it awkward.  She was very natural about it, and I felt natural talking about dating and relationships with her too.  I enjoyed my time in Connecticut.

I was excited to begin my last semester.  I wanted to end strong academically, socially, and spiritually.  I didn’t see any prospects as far as dating, but maybe someone would surprise me.
