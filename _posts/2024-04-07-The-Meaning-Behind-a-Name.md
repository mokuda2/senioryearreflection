title:  Chapter 2 - The Meaning Behind a Name
author: Michael Okuda
description: What does a name imply?
---

_(May 2023; college junior) When Mom, Dad, and I were in Palau, they asked me if I had been going on dates. I wasn’t ready to come out at that point. They probably still stuck to their definition of a “date”: when a guy and a girl plan to do something together and then do it. I was curious about what they felt about dating, not merely their definition. I decided to ask the questions I used to ask in my atheist days. “Why is it important to date?” I asked._

_“In the gospel, what ordinances and covenants do we make so that we can live with Heavenly Father?” Mom asked._

_Per the usual, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, the priesthood, the endowment… “And marriage,” I said._

_“Yeah. Dating is a step towards marriage.”_

_“But marriage is just an ordinance. I don’t have to date someone in order to get married. So why do I need to date someone?”_

_“It’s important that you get to know different girls,” Dad answered._

_“Why do I need to get to know different girls in order to marry?” I asked._

_“Because everyone is different. You’ll find that there are some things that you like and other things that you don’t like. Men and women are very different. When men find a girl to be attractive, it’s usually love at first sight, more about appearance. For women, they feel attracted to a guy on a more emotional level. I needed a woman like Mom. I just needed someone who’d be okay if we were quiet for 20 minutes. I had a friend when I was young who’d always hang out with me, and he was totally okay if there was silence for 20 minutes.”_

_“So that’s why you married Mom?” I asked._

_“Partly. I’m a boring man. I needed someone who would be okay with that.”_

_I guess that explained where my boring-man genes came from._

_“Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses,” Dad continued. “We’re not a very expressive family. I think one of the reasons why people have a hard time talking to Mom is because she doesn’t open up. And our children are like that, times two. I used to be that way too. I was really shy talking to girls.”_

_“What about talking to guys?”_

_“I think I just had a hard time talking to people in general. But now after all the church callings I’ve had, they got me out of my comfort zone, and I had to talk to people. I’ve become a lot better and more confident. But when you’re interested in a girl, if you were to go on a date, you’d have to ask her.”_

_“Why would I be interested in her?”_

_“Maybe because she’s nice.” That could’ve been a potential reason I’d date a guy._

_“So... Marriage is more than just a ceremony? You have to feel a certain way about someone?”_

_Both Mom and Dad nodded. I guess they weren’t as mechanical as I thought they were. It sounded like they knew what romantic love was. Maybe they’d have a level of understanding of my situation. Or maybe they wouldn’t and would act like privileged straight people. Either way, there was something that they should’ve been happy about. If they were more mechanical when it came to emotions, then all the times when I was with Gyuna would’ve fit Mom and Dad’s definition of a date. I definitely went on countless “dates” with her. But if Mom and Dad had some compassion, then maybe they’d see how much I had emotionally developed from dating guys. And I knew that I’d have to be patient with them, just as it took me a long time for me to accept my reality._

```My mom told me every day to always be careful of guys```

```Because love is like playing with fire. It can get you hurt, eh.```

```My mom might be right because when I see you, my heart fires up.```

```My attraction towards you is greater than the fear, eh.```

.

```I can't stop this trembling, on and on and on.```

```I wanna throw my all into your world.```

```Look at me, look at me now.```

```Look at how you’re making me nervous.```

```I can't stop it.```

```Our love is like playing with fire.```

.

(Chorus)

```My love is on fire.```

```Now burn, baby, burn.```

```Playing with fire.```

```My love is on fire.```

```So don't play with me, boy.```

```Playing with fire.```

.

```Oh no, I've already come too far.```

```Suddenly, none of this is a game anymore.```

```Love is like a spark of fire.```

```Let the wind blow. The fire will grow.```

```Even my mom doesn’t know if this is medicine or poison.```

```He stole my heart. (But where are the cops?)```

```You’re like the oil poured onto my burning heart.```

```Kiss him, will I diss him? I don't know, but I miss him.```

```This love that goes beyond addiction is crack.```

```The color of my heart is black.```

.

```I can't stop this trembling, on and on and on.```

```I wanna throw my all into your fire.```

```Look at me, look at me now.```

```Look at how you’re making me nervous.```

```I can't stop it.```

```Our love is like playing with fire.```

.

(Chorus)

```My love is on fire.```

```Now burn, baby, burn.```

```Playing with fire.```

```My love is on fire.```

```So don't play with me, boy.```

```Playing with fire.```

.

```It's raging out of control.```

```The fire is spreading too fast.```

```Don't stop me.```

```Let this love burn the night away.```

## Section 1

August 17, 2023.  "Nooooo.  Michael...”  I was at Gyuna’s place.  She put her hands on her forehead in distress.  “I like your eyes!  They're so good!"  I told her about the consultation I had with the plastic surgeon a few days before.

"I don't," I replied.

"You know when you smile and your eyes get that sparkle?  You're going to lose that after your surgery.  Your eyes are so catlike."

"I don't like that though.  I'd rather have them open when I smile."

"Michael...  I don't get why you want to do this to yourself!  Why do you want surgery?  Who influenced you to do this?”

“Mostly you,” I answered.  “I think I’d be more approachable.  Plus, I’d look more westernized.”

“I thought I’d be more approachable after getting my eyes done, but just know that people are still going to see you as an Asian.”  I could tell she had an internal conflict between not wanting me to get surgery and getting surgery herself.  “And monolids on Asian guys are hot.  If you want to do this surgery so you look more like a white person, that kind of mindset needs to change.  People don’t get eyelid surgery to look more white.”

I didn’t think that was entirely true.  People may get upper blepharoplasty (upper eyelid surgery) for medical reasons, but if it were for aesthetic reasons, it wasn’t like people desired to have slanted or almond eyes like Asians.  The reason was to look more westernized.

“People find Asian men unattractive,” I said.  “If I look more westernized, I feel like people will accept me more.”

“I can sort of understand that.  It’s the same with Asian women too.  But, Michael, if people are going to judge you because of your race, you shouldn’t be friends with those kinds of people.  Sure, you can respect them, but being around those kinds of people is toxic.  Go live in another country, somewhere that’s not the US or Europe.  You’ll realize that this ‘I’m not into Asians’ mindset isn’t there in other countries.”

When people answer who their celebrity crush is, 99.9 percent of the time it was a white person.  White was the global beauty standard, not just in the US.

America is considered a melting pot consisting of people from all over the world, but in American media, the hero or the protagonist is typically a white person.  Rarely is there representation of Asians in American media, especially an Asian hero.  When there is an Asian man in media, what role does he play?  Usually someone who’s presented as unfashionably geeky, emasculatingly comical, or socially incompetent.  I had never heard anyone say that their celebrity crush was an Asian man.  Asian men are rarely ever considered or represented as a model standard.  It definitely affects the way that not only viewers of media perceive Asian men but also Asian American men themselves.  So what could Asians do to look more like the heroes and models of media, the white people?

South Korea is considered the global capital of plastic surgery.  People all over the world go there to be put under the knife.  Beauty is a factor of influence when it comes to power, but it’s especially so in Korea, where academic and social intelligence aren’t the only heavily influenced factors in career advancement.  People pay lots of money to undergo blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty (nose jobs), jawline reduction, and other surgeries.  Most if not all K-pop stars undergo several plastic surgeries to fit Asian beauty standards—heavily influenced by westernization, such as double eyelids, a defined nose, and a non-square jaw.  Even though plastic surgery is expensive and doesn’t come without risks, I thought it would be worth the price and the experience to see what a blepharoplasty would be like.  It was the least risky compared to other facial plastic surgeries, and if I didn’t like it, at least I’d look more westernized.

...

July-August 2023.  I sent my reflection to my family about a month ago.  Only three days after I sent my reflection, my sister-in-law <span style="color:red">Deanna</span> sent me a text.  I didn’t expect someone to finish reading my reflection that soon, so my heart skipped a beat when I read the first sentence.

```Deanna: Michael, I just finished reading your reflection on your year. I was honored to hear your deep and contemplative thoughts as I may be considered "Okuda family" loosely.```

```If I were to summarize my thoughts, it would be these three points. You are heard. You are supported. You are loved for who you are.```

```I am so eternally grateful that you have friends who continually support you and encourage you.```

```Also, 2.25 is way too expensive for cookies and cream milk...back in my day it was 75 cents👵```

```I look forward to seeing you again this Christmas.```

```We are always here to support you any way we can.```

I felt so relieved to receive supportive words.

Then my brother <span style="color:red">Nozomu</span> finished it.  “I don’t support your decision to date guys, but I see you more than just your sexual orientation and still love you,” he said on the phone with me.  He said he had attended an event at BYU where a gay man talked about his experiences being married to a woman.  It sounded like Nozomu (and probably BYU back then) thought that because a few gay members can marry the opposite gender that it can work for everyone.  He asked me what my thoughts were.

“If that’s the personal revelation he received, I’m not one to say that he’s wrong,” I answered.  “I think it’s easy for straight people to think that the way they think and feel is the only and correct way.  I’ve realized how important personal revelation is because it’s unique to the individual, and God knows me better than anyone else does.  I prayed a lot about whether or not I should date guys.  I didn’t get a direct answer, so I acted.  I trusted that God would let me know if it wasn’t the right decision, and my dating experiences have brought forth good fruit.  I’ve gained a lot of emotional and spiritual growth from dating guys.”

It sounded like Nozomu didn’t expect that kind of answer.

I wanted to help connect the dots by relating an experience he had with romantic feelings.  “Why did you marry Deanna?” I asked.

He told me about how he and Deanna had met at BYU, how they had reconnected after BYU, and how she had come to New York to visit when he was getting his PhD.  “When she was about to leave, she and I both expressed that we didn’t want this time to end,” he said.

While Nozomu was very academically intelligent and knew a lot about data science and the realm that I was going into, he and I had very different views when it came to people and interactions.  He told me that he remembered at a young age when he heard the news about Hawaii allowing same-sex marriages, and he thought it would be much easier to marry one of his guy friends.  I asked him if he saw himself dating a guy before he began dating Deanna, to which he acted like he wasn’t straight or that I didn’t know anything about romantic feelings and contemplated the question.  I found it ironic that he said these things and also told me that he didn’t support my decision to date guys.  But at least I knew he wasn’t supportive of my decision and that I was in control with how much or how little I wanted to share about my dating life with him.

Then my brother-in-law <span style="color:red">David</span> emailed me thanking me for sharing my reflection with him.  He wrote that he had stopped attending church for a couple years.  As a priest quorum advisor, he said that one of the breaking points for him was when the bishop told the young men that people became gay because they liked the attention of coming out.  David sternly told the bishop how completely wrong that was, to which David got blocked from all youth leadership callings because he was “not safe for the children to be around” because of his “open opposition to church doctrine,” according to David’s quoting of the bishop.

Then my sister <span style="color:red">Shari</span> texted me:

Shari: I am only halfway through your reflection, but I just wanted to say that I love you and support you and I freaking ADORE Gyuna!!! I’m proud of you for your courage and faith and growth. Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing these things with me. I feel I understand you so much better and can finally connect better with you. I’ve always wanted that, but it’s been hard to know how to do. So thank you for sharing and helping me better understand you, and I hope you continue to keep this door open to us.

I still had yet to hear from <span style="color:red">President and Sister Okuda</span> about their thoughts, which was understandable because they were pretty occupied with their mission obligations.  But I especially wondered what their thoughts would be.

While it was relieving to hear most of my family members say that they were supportive of me, my skepticism regarding people saying one thing and meaning another continued to make me cautious about whether my family members truly meant what they said.  Words were theory to me, but the behaviors and intentions of reality were the tools to knock over my wall of skepticism.  In theory, most of my family members gave supporting words, but in reality, would they want to listen to me and want to learn more about my dating life?  Maybe the real question was if I would feel comfortable talking about my dating life with them.  I wasn’t sure what I could do to reassure myself that they were supportive of me.

...

“Michael!”  Gyuna gave me a call one day.  “I saw Bryce on campus!”

“Really?” I was surprised he was still at BYU.

“He was just chilling in one of the BYU security cars, but I talked to him, and I could tell he still hasn’t gotten over you.”

“What makes you say that?”

“He asked me how you were doing, and I could tell by his expression and his voice that he still misses you.  You heartbreaker, why don’t you reach out to him?”

“He said he didn’t see us being friends after we broke up, so I’m going to respect that.  If he wants to be friends, he’ll reach out.”

The morning after I had sent my reflection, I was surprised to get a text from Bryce.  It was a rather lengthy message about how it took him about a month to “get over” me and to not feel heartbroken.  He said he didn’t want to be friends right after our breakup because he didn’t think he’d maintain a mature composure being around me.  He said he wanted to be friends and that he couldn’t see me disappear from his life and that he didn’t want himself to disappear out of my life.

Didn’t sound like he had gotten over me.

```Me: I would be open to being friends. However, I want you to know that I don’t ever see us being in a relationship again. If it hurts to think of me swiping through dating apps, idk if being friends would be a good idea. So yeah, you can basically say that you’re getting friend zoned lol. It’ll stay that way. That’s an expectation I have.```

He and I texted a bit, and it sounded like he was going to be attending BYU in the fall instead of going to the police academy.  I told him when I’d be moving back to Provo and skeptically wondered if he and I would actually be friends.

## Section 2

President Okuda said he wanted to read my reflection with me because he thought it was too one-sided, that he couldn’t exchange ideas.  I read one of the chapters with him, but after that, I told him that I was open to questions and that I felt like his questions would be answered as he read by himself.  Coming out and all the implications of it was not just a five-minute conversation.  He also said it was bad communication to read the entire _Lord of the Rings_ or _Harry Potter_ series and share his thoughts at the end.  It sounded to me like he wasn’t interested in learning more about me.

“Dad is like a CEO,” Nozomu said during one conversation.  “CEOs like to get to the point and ask questions on the spot.  I think a written reflection like the one you gave was something I needed so that I could process the information.  Maybe not so for Dad.”

But President Okuda was more than just a CEO.  He was my father.  Throughout my pre-teen and teenage years, he told me frequently that I needed to express my feelings, and now I was taking the risk to do that for him.  Wasn’t that what he wanted?

Eventually, President Okuda read the part in my reflection where I had first come out.

```President Okuda: “Mom and Dad told me that a date was when a guy and a girl planned to do something and then actually do it. I guess their definition of a date wasn’t applicable if I was planning to do something with a guy.” So, before I got married, 99.9% of time, I spent my time with other boys. Boys like to do things with other boys. Girls like to do things with other girls. The 0.1% of time I spent my time with girls is mostly when I was very young (Phase 1). Those were the days that I didn’t have much distinction between boys and girls. As we become socially more aware, boys play with boys. Girls stop playing with boys. Boys’ best friends are boys. Girls’ best friends are girls (Phase 2). After spending lots of time with other boys, a time will come that boys start seeking spending time with select girls to get to know what girls are like as they are still unknown to boys (Phase 3). We call the 3rd phase “dating”. We don’t call Phase 1 or Phase 2 dating.```

```While you grew up, you hung out with girls over boys because you felt more comfortable. You were in Phase 1 for a very long time. I think you are just beginning Phase 2 now. Before you get to Phase 3, you need to have Phase 2. You used a dating app to find another boy to spend time with. Other boys in college also try to find other boys they can spend time with, but they don’t use dating apps. They just become friends in class, at work, in dorms, etc. Boys want to spend time with other boys. Girls do the same, but we don’t call that dating.```

```BTW, there is no romantic feelings in Phase 1. Phase 2 is full of liking and belonging and spending a lot of time together. Phase 3 has romantic feelings and even stronger feelings for bonding and being together.```

I found it ironic that he said that guys hung out with other guys but then pointed out that I hung out mostly with girls.  I also didn't understand how he missed the cue that I liked guys and that that was the reason why I was using dating apps.

```Me: So far, do you think that I’m wanting to get to know guys with no romantic interest involved?```

```President Okuda: I do not think you researched online dating apps because you developed a romantic feeling for a particular person. I think you wanted to find a friend. To establish a relationship, communication is key. Communication that builds a relationship must be bidirectional. When you are not good at communicating, it’s hard to establish a good relationship. You desire for someone you can communicate with. We all do. I believe, after interacting with Gyuna, you began wondering, perhaps, you should try finding a friend who is compatible with you and potentially land on developing a romantic relationship. I think your trying the dating app to find a friend is kind of like your applying for an internship. Your desire for getting a good internship is greatly influenced by someone around you who gave you that idea. I am not saying it’s bad. In fact, I am glad that you are seeking good internships (I advise my students to do so). At least originally, I think it was a simple experimentation. Since I haven’t read the rest of your essays, I cannot tell if you have a romantic feeling towards someone now or not.```

Gyuna burst into laughter when I told her about President Okuda’s thoughts when he read about the first time I admitted that I liked guys.  “I think it’s kinda obvious that you’re gay,” she said.

The way that President Okuda responded to my reflection made me realize that I definitely did a good job at suppressing my emotions around him and Sister Okuda.  That was the goal so that they wouldn’t get even a hint that I was gay.  President Okuda made it sound like I didn’t have any friends in high school.

## Section 3

August 25, 2023.  It was the day of the surgery.  I was super nervous, but before I was taken to the operating room, I was knocked out.  Shari was gracious enough to take me to and from the hospital.

During the first few days, I lied in bed almost all day with a pack of ice on my eyelids.  Gyuna wasn’t wrong about looking like a monster.  I looked pretty awful with stitches in my eyelids.

After about a week, I went back to the doctor to get my stitches taken out, but I still looked terrifying.  I wore a pair of sunglasses everywhere with me.  When I was on campus without my sunglasses on, people didn’t want to make eye contact, so I kept my sunglasses on for the first month post-surgery.

...

September 5, 2023.  Another semester of school began.

Gyuna sent an Instagram post about an LGBTQ institute class at the Utah Valley Institute building.  I was interested in going, but I was a bit nervous.  I had never put myself out there like that.  What motivated me to go was the goal I had made of finding good friends and good influences in the LGBTQ community, so I made plans to go to the first class.

“I’m a bit nervous about it, but I want to go,” I said.  Gyuna and I were on campus in the early evening.  I talked to her about the institute class she shared.  She decided to go with me, which I was grateful for.  I wasn’t sure if I actually would’ve gone by myself.

Two individuals conducted the class.  One was Sister Chipman, an ally.  At the beginning of every class, she shared a quote from a BYU devotional Elder Ballard gave in 2017:

```“I want anyone who is a member of the church who is gay or lesbian to know I believe you have a place in the kingdom and recognize that sometimes it may be difficult for you to see where you fit in the Lord’s Church, but you do. We need to listen to and understand what our LGBT brothers and sisters are feeling and experiencing. Certainly, we must do better than we have done in the past so that all members feel they have a spiritual home where their brothers and sisters love them and where they have a place to worship and serve the Lord.”```

The other person who ran the class was Brother Barrow, a gay member of the Church who was in a mixed-orientation marriage (meaning he's gay but married to a woman).  He always introduced himself as a gay Latter-day Saint.  One thing he repeatedly said was that his membership in the Church was one of the greatest blessings in his life and that his membership in the Church also gave him some of the most painful experiences in his life.  Despite the opposites, he was okay with the “and”s.  The Church is a blessing AND the Church brings pain.

During the class, a guy shared his journey and his relationship with his family and the Church.  I recognized that he was in one of my previous wards, so I was a bit surprised to see him.

“Did you cry?” Gyuna asked me after he shared his story.

It was a story like many others, but I really felt the Spirit and resonated with some of his experiences.  It had been a while since I had felt the Spirit like that.

After the class, Gyuna talked to him, and some other people introduced themselves and talked to us.  Some of them even asked if we were coming back, which was encouraging.  I DID want to come back.

“That was really good,” I said as Gyuna and I drove back to Provo.  “I actually want to go back next week.  I felt like I belonged there.  People were friendlier there than in my ward.”

“Duh yeah,” Gyuna exclaimed.  She had been to a couple of my ward’s activities.

One of the nice things about institute was that I didn’t feel a sense of BYU’s dating culture.  People didn’t get to know each other merely because they could be dating prospects.  For once, I felt like people weren’t cliquey.

...

A few days later, I bumped into the same guy from institute who had shared his story.  While he and I were conversing, he brought up something called Gather Conference.  He said over a thousand LGBTQ members of the Church and allies would attend the event where panelists would share their experiences about faith and orientation.  The event sounded interesting, so I registered for it.

Gather Conference was a two-day event.  After my afternoon class, I headed to the convention center in downtown Provo.  By that time, people were split up into different groups to listen to panelists, so I chose one to go to.

The whole conference was eye-opening for me.  I realized that there were so many people who were like me, someone who valued both the gospel and orientation.  The panels had people from diverse backgrounds.  Some were in same-sex marriages and relationships; others were in mixed-orientation marriages.  There was even a transgender woman and a non-binary person, parts of the LGBTQ community I had never interacted with and didn’t even think that those parts of the community would’ve wanted any association with the Church.

As I got to know more people in the LGBTQ community, I learned that a couple of big names in the intersection of the LDS community and the LGBTQ community were Ben Schilaty and Charlie Bird.  Ben used to work at BYU in the honor code office.  Charlie used to be BYU’s mascot, Cosmo the Cougar.  He had gotten married to a man last month, which was positively astounding.  They must have been lucky to be in a supporting ward since they were still active in the Church.

I didn’t attend the entire conference due to classes and other things in my schedule, but <u>one thing that stuck out to me was a few panelists’ perspectives of not having a sad heaven.</u>  They believed that God wouldn’t separate a family where an LGBTQ person couldn’t be in the celestial kingdom with the other family members.  The panelists said that they didn’t see it as heaven if their whole family wasn’t in the celestial kingdom with them, that it would bring them anguish.  In other words, they didn’t believe the paradox that celestial beings could be celestial in heaven while being separated from those who meant the most to them.

At the beginning of the dinner break on the first day, I found the guy from institute who had told me about the conference and decided to tag along with him since I was alone and didn’t really know anyone else.  One of his friends invited me to dinner with them and a group of other people.  His name was <span style="color:red">Tao</span>.  Even though the guy from institute didn’t talk to me much from the conference onward, he was a steppingstone to Tao and his group of friends.

I realized that I had found my people: those who valued both the gospel and their sense of identity in the LGBTQ community.  People knew I was gay, and I didn’t have to hide that part of me.  These people understood.  They understood from their perspectives how difficult it was being in the intersection of the LDS community and the LGBTQ community, yet they treasured both.

In the early days of the Restoration of the Church, members were driven from their homes several times.  When I think of those in the Church who are called “pioneers,” I think about those who had crossed the Great Plains and settled in present-day Utah.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a pioneer is “a person or group that originates or helps open up a new line of thought or activity or a new method or technical development; one of the first to settle in a territory.”  The pioneers’ actions of settling into unknown territory was a mechanical manifestation of the definition, but the term “pioneer” possesses more than just the physical aspect.

Again, members in the early days of the Church were often looked down upon by others in their city.  They were persecuted for their beliefs and had to flee to safety.  They not only had to adapt to a different physical environment, but they also had to adapt to their new way of life and beliefs—beliefs that didn’t have living precedence other than the divine beings involved in the revelations that Joseph Smith received.  These pioneers had to learn to keep moving forward in the faith, even if they were hated and their circumstances tumultuous.

Similarly, being part of Gather Conference’s congregation of LGBTQ members and allies made me realize that we were pioneers in our own way.  Physically, we weren’t trekking to a foreign environment, but we had to learn to accept our differences, even when people persecuted us and tried to tear down our testimonies.  Persecution came from both the LDS community and the LGBTQ community.  That was why being in the intersection of both communities was extremely vulnerable.  But I didn’t believe that faith and orientation were black and white, that I had to choose one and leave the other behind.

...

September 21, 2023.  Earlier in the month, I was told to apply for the full-time position as a data analyst at AT&T.  A couple weeks later, I received an offer letter!

After a couple weeks of going through the negotiation process, I signed the final offer.  It was a relief that I had a job secured post-graduation.  I felt especially lucky because the STEM job market was pretty bad this school year.  Job hunting between the time my internship ended and the time that I received the full-time offer was painful enough.

But even though I was glad that I had plans after graduation, there was something that felt unsettling about it all.  Moving to Dallas...
