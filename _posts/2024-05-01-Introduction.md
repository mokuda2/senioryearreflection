Welcome to my reflection!

The purpose of my reflection is to tell my story about what it’s like to be gay, Asian, and LDS as a BYU student.  I feel that listening to an individual’s story is a lot more intimate than generalizing about groups of people from second-hand sources.

This reflection is very personal to me.  With that being said, I am extremely honest about my experiences and perspectives toward the LGBTQ community, the Church, and BYU.  Some passages may make you feel uncomfortable, and I am not ignorant of that.  My hope is that readers keep in mind that this is only one person’s experiences and that my feelings toward the LGBTQ community, the BYU community, and the Asian community are not necessarily generalizable to everyone’s experiences within any of those communities.

I would like to give credit to one of my statistics professors, Dr. Shannon Tass, for creating the GitHub repository that holds this reflection.

A few things to know:

_Passages in italics are flashbacks of the past._ They are copy-and-paste passages from previous reflections.  I will pull several passages from my junior year reflection, especially in the first two chapters, to give context to my experiences.

<u>I underline passages of my reflection that I feel are important and relevant for understanding later parts of my reflection.</u> Hopefully those passages will help guide you in understanding what I feel is the purpose of this reflection.

<span style="color:red">Words or phrases in red are important concepts or people to keep in mind while reading.</span> I hope this will also help with relevance and purpose of my reflection.

For safety and privacy reasons, I have not used the actual names of those in the LGBTQ community (except for those who are well-known in the community).

Chapter 1 is mostly a summary of my junior year reflection and anything that will help bring context in passages of my senior year.  Starting in chapter 2, I pick up where I left off from my junior year reflection and jump into my senior year.

I hope you can take away something valuable from my reflection, whether it be a perspective you’ve never heard or thought of before or a lesson learned from my experiences.  Again, I hope you enjoy reading my reflection!
