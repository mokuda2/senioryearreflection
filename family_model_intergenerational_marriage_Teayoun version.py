"""
This version of the Variant Target Model results in a graph with (potentially)
many components (returned as G by human_family_network()) and a version with a
single weakly connected component (returned as G_connected by
human_family_network()) (see Chapter 5 in Kolton's thesis))

The main guts of the model are in the human_family_network() method.  There is
an example of how to run the model commented out below human_family_network()

    """
    This is the main driver for implementing the Variant Target Model (see
    Chapter 5 in Kolton's thesis).
    PARAMETERS:
        num_people (int): number of people (nodes) to include in initial
            generation
        marriage_dists: (list of int) one entry per marriage indicating how many
            generations between spouses (reported in the number of parent-child
            edges crossed so that distance between siblings is 2) in the
            specified dataset.  If no common ancestor (IE an infinite distance)
            then the corresponding entry is -1
        prob_finite_marriage (float): probability of marriage being drawn from
            the finite portion of marriage_dist (herein defined and treated as
            finite_marriage_probs)
        prob_inf_marriage (float): probability of marriage to a non-connected
            person.
            NOTE: prob_finite_marriage + prob_inf_marriage + prob_single = 1
        children_dist: (list of int) one entry per pair of parents, indicating
            how many child edges each parent in the couple share
        name: (str) name for prefix of saved files
        when_to_stop: (int) target number of nodes to capture.  If supplied, the
            model will run until this target number of nodes (all together, not
            just the size of the current generation) is surpassed.
        num_gens (int): max number of generations for network to grow beyond the
            initial generation.  Default is np.inf.  If np.inf, then the model
            will run until the number of nodes in the example network is
            surpassed and then stop.
        save (bool): should you save pickled versions of networkx graphs, model
            union edges, and distance to union and child distributions, as well
            as png graphs of distance to union updates each generation as well
            as an xlsx file summarizing model growth?
        out_dir (str): destination directory for save output.  Each run will
            create an out_dir/{name}_{int}/ file structure, counting version
            number automatically
    RETURNS:
    G, G_connected, all_marriage_edges, all_marriage_distances, all_children_per_couple, dies_out, output_path
        G (nx.DiGraph):  modeled network.  This graph can have MANY COMPONENTS.
            Each node has the following attributes: 1) layer: either an int
                indicating the vertice's generation 2) immigrant: bool
                indicating whether the vertex had parents in the graph when the
                vertex was originally added to the graph.  All vertices in the
                initial generation are immigrants, as are those brought in to
                form additional infinite-distance unions. 3) parents: int in
                {0, 1, 2}, counting the number of incoming parent-child type
                edges.  When joining up components into a single component
                (forming G_connected), we only allow immigrant vertices to have
                at most two incoming ancestral lines (i.e. paternal and
                maternal).
            Each edge has the following attributes: 1) Relationship: str, either
                "Marriage" to indicate a union edge or "Parent-Child".  Again,
                Parent-Child edges go from parent to child.
        G_connected (nx.DiGraph): modeled network formatted as above, but
            with auxillary ancestry forming a single connected component out of
            the (many) components in G.  Vertices in G_connected may have their
            'layer' attribute set to 'setup', indicating that the vertex is part
            of an auxiliary ancestral line which was introduced to connect two
            immigrant vertices in different components via a common ancestor.
            Additionally, these now connected immigrant vertices will have their
            'parents' attribute incremented to either 1 or 2.
            G is a subgraph of G_connected.
        all_marriage_edges (list of tuples of int): this lists all union-type
            edges added to G (indicated by node attribtute
            "Relationship"=="Marriage").  NOTE:  The auxiliary ancestry added
            prior to generation 0 contains no union-type edges, so that G and
            G_connected share the same list of union edges.
        all_marriage_distances (list of int): this lists all distances prior to
            union for each union edge in all_marriage_edges (orders match).
            NOTE: these distances are those as observed in G with auxiliary
            ancestry prior to generation 0.  These distances are also the
            distances for the unions in G_connected.
        all_children_per_couple (list of int): this lists the number of children
            per union edge in G and in G_connected.  NOTE: because the auxiliary
            ancestry contains no union edges, the parent-child relationships
            encoded therein do not affect this distribution.  That is, G and
            G_connected have the exact same list of children per union.
        dies_out (bool):  False indicates that the model exited successfully---
            generations 0 to L (inclusive) contain more than when_to_stop nodes
            in total OR L >= num_gens.  True else.
        output_path (str): None if save==False, else out_dir/{name}_{int},
            counting version number automatically.
